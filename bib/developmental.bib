   abstract = {The long-term production of billions of spermatozoa relies on the regulated proliferation and differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). To date only a few factors are known to function in SSCs to provide this regulation. Octamer-4 (OCT4) plays a critical role in pluripotency and cell survival of embryonic stem cells and primordial germ cells; however, it is not known whether it plays a similar function in SSCs. Here, we show that OCT4 is required for SSC maintenance in culture and for colonization activity following cell transplantation, using lentiviral-mediated short hairpin RNA expression to knock down OCT4 in an in vitro model for SSCs ("germline stem" [GS] cells). Expression of promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger (PLZF), a factor known to be required for SSC self-renewal, was not affected by OCT4 knockdown, suggesting that OCT4 does not function upstream of PLZF. In addition to developing a method to test specific gene function in GS cells, we demonstrate that retinoic acid (RA) triggers GS cells to shift to a differentiated, premeiotic state lacking OCT4 and PLZF expression and colonization activity. Our data support a model in which OCT4 and PLZF maintain SSCs in an undifferentiated state and RA triggers spermatogonial differentiation through the direct or indirect downregulation of OCT4 and PLZF. The current study has important implications for the future use of GS cells as an in vitro model for spermatogonial stem cell biology or as a source of embryonic stem-like cells. Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest is found at the end of this article.},

   abstract = {Transcription of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) is inhibited by de novo DNA methylation during gametogenesis, a process initiated after birth in oocytes and at approximately embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) in prospermatogonia. Earlier in germline development, the genome, including most retrotransposons, is progressively demethylated. Young ERVK and ERV1 elements, however, retain intermediate methylation levels. As DNA methylation reaches a low point in E13.5 primordial germ cells (PGCs) of both sexes, we determined whether retrotransposons are marked by H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 using a recently developed low-input ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation [ChIP] combined with deep sequencing) method. Although these repressive histone modifications are found predominantly on distinct genomic regions in E13.5 PGCs, they concurrently mark partially methylated long terminal repeats (LTRs) and LINE1 elements. Germline-specific conditional knockout of the H3K9 methyltransferase SETDB1 yields a decrease of both marks and DNA methylation at H3K9me3-enriched retrotransposon families. Strikingly, Setdb1 knockout E13.5 PGCs show concomitant derepression of many marked ERVs, including intracisternal A particle (IAP), ETn, and ERVK10C elements, and ERV-proximal genes, a subset in a sex-dependent manner. Furthermore, Setdb1 deficiency is associated with a reduced number of male E13.5 PGCs and postnatal hypogonadism in both sexes. Taken together, these observations reveal that SETDB1 is an essential guardian against proviral expression prior to the onset of de novo DNA methylation in the germline.},

   abstract = {Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) possess the capacity of self-renewal and differentiation, which are the basis of spermatogenesis. In maintenance of SSC homeostasis, intrinsic/extrinsic factors and various signaling pathways tightly control the fate of SSCs. Methyltransferase SETDB1 (Set domain, bifurcated 1) catalyzes histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) trimethylation and represses gene expression. SETDB1 is required for maintaining the survival of spermatogonial stem cells in mice. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we found that Setdb1 regulates PTEN/AKT/FOXO1 pathway to inhibit SSC apoptosis. Co-immunoprecipitation and reporter gene assay revealed that SETDB1 interacted and coordinated with AKT to regulate FOXO1 activity and expression of the downstream target genes Bim and Puma. Among the SETDB1-bound genes, the H3K9me3 levels on the promoter regions of Bim and Pten decreased in Setdb1-KD group; in contrast, H3K9me3 status on promoters of Bax and Puma remained unchanged. Therefore, SETDB1 was responsible for regulating the transcription activity of genes in the apoptotic pathway at least in part through modulating H3K9me3. This study replenishes the research on the epigenetic regulation of SSC survival, and provides a new insight for the future study of epigenetic regulation of spermatogenesis.},

Here, we show that ATF7IP is essential for SETDB1 stability: nuclear SETDB1 protein is degraded by the proteasome upon ablation of ATF7IP. As a result, ATF7IP is critical for repression that requires H3K9 trimethylation by SETDB1, including transgene silencing by the HUSH complex. Furthermore, we show that loss of ATF7IP phenocopies loss of SETDB1 in genome-wide assays. ATF7IP and SETDB1 knockout cells exhibit near-identical defects in the global deposition of H3K9me3, which results in similar dysregulation of the transcriptome. Overall, these data identify a critical functional role for ATF7IP in heterochromatin formation by regulating SETDB1 abundance in the nucleus.},

Although autophagy is involved in the spermatogenesis process, the molecular pathways and regulations of autophagy in germ cell development remain elusive. Here, we showed that Ppp1r36, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1, is expressed during gonadal development, mainly in testes during spermatogenesis. Autophagy protein LC3 (microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3), especially its active form LC3-II, had a similar expression pattern to Ppp1r36. Moreover, LC3-II level and puncta analysis showed that autophagy is up-regulated around 21 dpp (day postpartum) in postnatal testis, indicating a potential role of autophagy during the first wave of spermatogenesis. We demonstrated that Ppp1r36 promotes autophagosome formation upon starvation induction. Further autophagy flux analysis using a tandem fluorescent indicator, mCherry-GFP-LC3, confirmed that Ppp1r36 participated in autophagy. We further determined that Ppp1r36 is associated with Atg16L1 (autophagy related 16-like 1) in autophagy of starvation induction. Thus, our results uncover a potential role of the regulatory subunit Ppp1r36 of protein phosphatase 1 in enhancing autophagy during spermatogenesis.},

Alterations of DNA methylation with age have been shown in various somatic cell types. We investigated whether Tet1 and Tet2 regulate aging. We showed that Tet1-deficient mice undergo a progressive reduction of spermatogonia stem cells and spermatogenesis and thus accelerated infertility with age. Tet1 deficiency decreases 5hmC levels in spermatogonia and downregulates a subset of genes important for cell cycle, germ cell differentiation, meiosis and reproduction, such as Ccna1 and Spo11, resulting in premature reproductive aging. Moreover, Tet1 and 5hmC both regulate signaling pathways key for stem cell development, including Wnt and PI3K-Akt, autophagy and stress response genes. In contrast, effect of Tet2 deficiency on male reproductive aging is minor. Hence, Tet1 maintains spermatogonia stem cells with age, revealing an important role of Tet1 in regulating stem cell aging.

We establish a biologically robust profile of lncRNA expression in these two cell types and further confirm that the majority of these lncRNAs are enriched in the nucleus. Applying weighted gene coexpression network analysis, we define a group of lncRNAs that are tightly associated with the pluripotent state of ESCs. Among these, we show that acute depletion of Platr14 using antisense oligonucleotides impacts the differentiation- And development-associated gene expression program of ESCs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Firre, a lncRNA highly enriched in the nucleoplasm and previously reported to mediate chromosomal contacts in ESCs, controls a network of genes related to RNA processing. Together, we provide a comprehensive, up-to-date, and high resolution compilation of lncRNA expression in ESCs and NPCs and show that nuclear lncRNAs are tightly integrated into the regulation of ESC gene expression.},

   abstract = {Background: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a type of epigenetic regulator, are thought to play important roles in embryonic development in mice, and several developmental defects are associated with epigenetic modification disorders. The most dramatic epigenetic reprogramming event occurs during somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) when the expression profile of a differentiated cell is abolished, and a newly embryo-specific expression profile is established. However, the molecular mechanism underlying somatic reprogramming remains unclear, and the dynamics and functions of lncRNAs in this process have not yet been illustrated, resulting in inefficient reprogramming. Results: In this study, 63 single-cell RNA-seq libraries were first generated and sequenced. A total of 7009 mouse polyadenylation lncRNAs (including 5204 novel lncRNAs) were obtained, and a comprehensive analysis of in vivo and SCNT mouse pre-implantation embryo lncRNAs was further performed based on our single-cell RNA sequencing data. Expression profile analysis revealed that lncRNAs were expressed in a developmental stage-specific manner during mouse early-stage embryonic development, whereas a more temporal and spatially specific expression pattern was identified in mouse SCNT embryos with changes in the state of chromatin during somatic cell reprogramming, leading to incomplete zygotic genome activation, oocyte to embryo transition and 2-cell to 4-cell transition. No obvious differences between other stages and mouse NTC or NTM embryos at the same stage were observed. Gene oncology (GO) enrichment analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of lncRNAs and their association with known protein-coding genes suggested that several lncRNAs and their associated with known protein-coding genes might be involved in mouse embryonic development and cell reprogramming. Conclusions: This is a novel report on the expression landscapes of lncRNAs of mouse NT embryos by scRNA-seq analysis. This study will provide insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the involvement of lncRNAs in mouse pre-implantation embryonic development and epigenetic reprogramming in mammalian species after SCNT-based cloning.},

Much of this unique gene expression takes 28 place when mitotic germ cells differentiate and enter into meiotic prophase. Here, we 29 demonstrate that the genome-wide reorganization of super-enhancers (SEs) drives bursts of 30 germline genes after the mitosis-to-meiosis transition. At the mitosis-to-meiosis transition, 31 mitotic SEs dissolve while meiotic SEs are established. Meiotic SEs are associated with the 32 activation of key germline genes, defining the cellular identity of germ cells. This SE switching 33 is regulated by the establishment of meiotic SEs via A-MYB (MYBL1), a key transcription 34 factor for germline genes, and by the resolution of mitotic SEs via SCML2, a germline-specific 35 Polycomb protein required for spermatogenesis-specific gene expression. Prior to the entry 36 into meiosis, meiotic SEs are preprogrammed in mitotic spermatogonia, serving to direct the 37 unidirectional differentiation of spermatogenesis. We identify key regulatory factors for both 38 mitotic and meiotic enhancers, revealing a molecular logic for the concurrent activation of 39 mitotic enhancers and suppression of meiotic enhancers in the somatic and/or mitotically 40 proliferating phase.},

Through development of inducible knockout models, we show that short-term integrity of differentiating but not undifferentiated populations requires SALL4. However, SALL4 loss was associated with long-term functional decline of undifferentiated spermatogonia and disrupted stem cell-driven regeneration. Mechanistically, SALL4 associated with the NuRD co-repressor and repressed expression of the tumor suppressor genes Foxl1 and Dusp4. Aberrant Foxl1 activation inhibited undifferentiated cell growth and survival, while DUSP4 suppressed self-renewal pathways. We therefore uncover an essential role for SALL4 in maintenance of undifferentiated spermatogonial activity and identify regulatory pathways critical for germline stem cell function.},

Although Stat5a and Stat5b show peptide sequence similarities of >90%, targeted gene disruptions in mice yield distinctive phenotypes. Prolactin-directed mammary gland maturation fails without functional Stat5a, while disruption of Stat5b in males mitigates growth hormone effects on hepatic function and body mass. The molecular basis for this biologic dichotomy is probably multifaceted. Limited structural dissimilarities between the Stat5a and Stat5b transactivation domains, or subtle differences in the DNA-binding affinities of Stat5 dimer pairs undoubtedly influence gene regulation, but cell-dependent asymmetries in availability of phosphorylated Stat5 can be an underlying factor. Differences in serine phosphorylation(s) of Stat5a and Stat5b, or Stat5 associations with adaptor proteins or co-transcription factors are other potential sources of functional disparity and the signal amplitude, frequency or duration also can be significant. In addition to Stat5 signal attenuation by phosphatase actions or classical feedback inhibition, truncated forms of Stat5 lacking in transactivation capacity may compete upstream for activation and diminish access of full length molecules to DNA binding sites.},

We examined dynamic changes in protein-DNA interactions at the Pgk2 gene promoter during murine spermatogenesis in vivo by performing genomic footprinting and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with enriched populations of murine spermatogenic cells at stages prior to, during, and following transcription of this gene. We found that genes encoding the testis-specific homeodomain factor PBX4 and its coactivator, PREP1, are expressed in patterns that mirror expression of the Pgk2 gene and that these factors become bound to the Pgk2 enhancer in cells in which this gene is actively expressed. We therefore suggest that these factors, along with CREM and SP3, direct stage- and cell type-specific transcription of the Pgk2 gene during spermatogenesis. We propose that binding of PBX4, plus its coactivator PREP1, is a rate-limiting step leading to the initiation of tissue-specific transcription of the Pgk2 gene. This study provides insight into the developmentally dynamic establishment of tissue-specific protein-DNA interactions in vivo. It also allows us to speculate about the events that led to tissue-specific regulation of the Pgk2 gene during mammalian evolution. },

Here we describe a candidate pluripotency factor, Ronin, that possesses a THAP domain, which is associated with sequence-specific DNA binding and epigenetic silencing of gene expression. Ronin is expressed primarily during the earliest stages of murine embryonic development, and its deficiency in mice produces periimplantational lethality and defects in the inner cell mass. Conditional knockout of Ronin prevents the growth of ES cells while forced expression of Ronin allows ES cells to proliferate without differentiation under conditions that normally do not promote self-renewal. Ectopic expression also partly compensates for the effects of Oct4 knockdown. We demonstrate that Ronin binds directly to HCF-1, a key transcriptional regulator. Our findings identify Ronin as an essential factor underlying embryogenesis and ES cell pluripotency.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Numerous studies over the past decade have elucidated a large set of long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) in the human genome. Research since has shown that lincRNAs constitute an important layer of genome regulation across a wide spectrum of species. However, the factors governing their evolution and origins remain relatively unexplored. One possible factor driving lincRNA evolution and biological function is transposable element (TE) insertions. Here, we comprehensively characterize the TE content of lincRNAs relative to genomic averages and protein coding transcripts.
RESULTS: Our analysis of the TE composition of 9,241 human lincRNAs revealed that, in sharp contrast to protein coding genes, 83% of lincRNAs contain a TE, and TEs comprise 42% of lincRNA sequence. lincRNA TE composition varies significantly from genomic averages - L1 and Alu elements are depleted and broad classes of endogenous retroviruses are enriched. TEs occur in biased positions and orientations within lincRNAs, particularly at their transcription start sites, suggesting a role in lincRNA transcriptional regulation. Accordingly, we observed a dramatic example of HERVH transcriptional regulatory signals correlating strongly with stem cell-specific expression of lincRNAs. Conversely, lincRNAs devoid of TEs are expressed at greater levels than lincRNAs with TEs in all tissues and cell lines, particularly in the testis.
CONCLUSIONS: TEs pervade lincRNAs, dividing them into classes, and may have shaped lincRNA evolution and function by conferring tissue-specific expression from extant transcriptional regulatory signals.},

   abstract = {The importance of microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs in the regulation of pluripotency has been documented; however, the noncoding components of stem cell gene networks remain largely unknown. Here we investigate the role of noncoding RNAs in the pluripotent state, with particular emphasis on nuclear and retrotransposon-derived transcripts. We have performed deep profiling of the nuclear and cytoplasmic transcriptomes of human and mouse stem cells, identifying a class of previously undetected stem cell-specific transcripts. We show that long terminal repeat (LTR)-derived transcripts contribute extensively to the complexity of the stem cell nuclear transcriptome. Some LTR-derived transcripts are associated with enhancer regions and are likely to be involved in the maintenance of pluripotency. © 2014 Nature America, Inc.},

   abstract = {Understanding the extent of genomic transcription and its functional relevance is a central goal in genomics research. However, detailed genome-wide investigations of transcriptome complexity in major mammalian organs have been scarce. Here, using extensive RNA-seq data, we show that transcription of the genome is substantially more widespread in the testis than in other organs across representative mammals. Furthermore, we reveal that meiotic spermatocytes and especially postmeiotic round spermatids have remarkably diverse transcriptomes, which explains the high transcriptome complexity of the testis as a whole. The widespread transcriptional activity in spermatocytes and spermatids encompasses protein-coding and long noncoding RNA genes but also poorly conserves intergenic sequences, suggesting that it may not be of immediate functional relevance. Rather, our analyses of genome-wide epigenetic data suggest that this prevalent transcription, which most likely promoted the birth of new genes during evolution, is facilitated by an overall permissive chromatin in these germ cells that results from extensive chromatin remodeling. © 2013 The Authors.},

   abstract = {Gene regulation in the germline ensures the production of high-quality gametes, long-term maintenance of the species, and speciation. Germline transcriptomes undergo dynamic changes after the mitosis-to-meiosis transition in males and have been subject to evolutionary divergence among mammals. However, the mechanism that underlies germline regulatory divergence remains undetermined. Here, we show that endogenous retroviruses influence species-specific germline transcriptomes in mammals. We show that the expression of endogenous retroviruses, particularly the evolutionarily young K family (ERVK), is associated with gene activation after the mitosis-to-meiosis transition in male mice. We demonstrate that accessible chromatin and H3K27ac, a marker of active enhancers, are tightly associated with ERVK loci as well as with the activation of neighboring evolutionarily young germline genes. Thus, ERVKs serve as evolutionarily novel enhancers in mouse spermatogenesis. These ERVK loci bear binding motifs for critical regulators of spermatogenesis such as A-MYB. The genome-wide transposition of ERVKs might have rewired germline gene expression in a species-specific manner. Notably, these features are present in human spermatogenesis, but independently evolved ERVs are associated with expression of germline genes, demonstrating the prevalence of ERV-driven mechanisms in mammals. Together, we propose a model whereby species-specific transcriptomes are fine-tuned by endogenous retroviruses in the mammalian germline.},

   abstract = {© 2017 The Authors. Published under the terms of the CC BY 4.0 license Spermatogenesis is associated with major and unique changes to chromosomes and chromatin. Here, we sought to understand the impact of these changes on spermatogenic transcriptomes. We show that long terminal repeats (LTRs) of specific mouse endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) drive the expression of many long non-coding transcripts (lncRNA). This process occurs post-mitotically predominantly in spermatocytes and round spermatids. We demonstrate that this transposon-driven lncRNA expression is a conserved feature of vertebrate spermatogenesis. We propose that transposon promoters are a mechanism by which the genome can explore novel transcriptional substrates, increasing evolutionary plasticity and allowing for the genesis of novel coding and non-coding genes. Accordingly, we show that a small fraction of these novel ERV-driven transcripts encode short open reading frames that produce detectable peptides. Finally, we find that distinct ERV elements from the same subfamilies act as differentially activated promoters in a tissue-specific context. In summary, we demonstrate that LTRs can act as tissue-specific promoters and contribute to post-mitotic spermatogenic transcriptome diversity.},

Different high-throughput methods for single-cell RNA-seq have been introduced that vary in coverage, sensitivity and multiplexing ability. We recently introduced Smart-seq for transcriptome analysis from single cells, and we subsequently optimized the method for improved sensitivity, accuracy and full-length coverage across transcripts. Here we present a detailed protocol for Smart-seq2 that allows the generation of full-length cDNA and sequencing libraries by using standard reagents. The entire protocol takes ∼2 d from cell picking to having a final library ready for sequencing; sequencing will require an additional 1-3 d depending on the strategy and sequencer. The current limitations are the lack of strand specificity and the inability to detect nonpolyadenylated (polyA(-)) RNA.},

   abstract = {At least 5% of the human genome predating the mammalian radiation is thought to have evolved under purifying selection, yet protein-coding and related untranslated exons occupy at most 2% of the genome. Thus, the majority of conserved and, by extension, functional sequence in the human genome seems to be nonexonic. Recent work has highlighted a handful of cases where mobile element insertions have resulted in the introduction of novel conserved nonexonic elements. Here, we present a genome-wide survey of 10,402 constrained nonexonic elements in the human genome that have all been deposited by characterized mobile elements. These repeat instances have been under strong purifying selection since at least the boreoeutherian ancestor (100 Mya). They are most often located in gene deserts and show a strong preference for residing closest to genes involved in development and transcription regulation. In particular, constrained nonexonic elements with clear repetitive origins are located near genes involved in cell adhesion, including all characterized cellular members of the reelin-signaling pathway. Overall, we find that mobile elements have contributed at least 5.5% of all constrained non-exonic elements unique to mammals, suggesting that mobile elements may have played a larger role than previously recognized in shaping and specializing the landscape of gene regulation during mammalian evolution. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

While most ERVs are relics of ancient integration events, "young" proviruses competent for retrotransposition-found in many mammals, but not humans-represent an ongoing threat to host fitness. As a consequence, several restriction pathways have evolved to suppress their activity at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional stages of the viral life cycle. Nevertheless, accumulating evidence has revealed that LTR sequences derived from distantly related ERVs have been exapted as regulatory sequences for many host genes in a wide range of cell types throughout mammalian evolution. Here, we focus on emerging themes from recent studies cataloging the diversity of ERV LTRs acting as important transcriptional regulatory elements in mammals and explore the molecular features that likely account for LTR exaptation in developmental and tissue-specific gene regulation.},

   abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) have been shown to contain functional binding sites for certain transcription factors (TFs). However, the extent to which TEs contribute to the evolution of TF binding sites is not well known. We comprehensively mapped binding sites for 26 pairs of orthologous TFs in two pairs of human and mouse cell lines (representing two cell lineages), along with epigenomic profiles, including DNA methylation and six histone modifications. Overall, we found that 20% of binding sites were embedded within TEs. This number varied across different TFs, ranging from 2% to 40%. We further identified 710 TF-TE relationships in which genomic copies of a TE subfamily contributed a significant number of binding peaks for a TF, and we found that LTR elements dominated these relationships in human. Importantly, TE-derived binding peaks were strongly associated with open and active chromatin signatures, including reduced DNA methylation and increased enhancer-associated histone marks. On average, 66% of TE-derived binding events were cell type-specific with a cell type-specific epigenetic landscape. Most of the binding sites contributed by TEs were species-specific, but we also identified binding sites conserved between human and mouse, the functional relevance of which was supported by a signature of purifying selection on DNA sequences of these TEs. Interestingly, several TFs had significantly expanded binding site landscapes only in one species, which were linked to species-specific gene functions, suggesting that TEs are an important driving force for regulatory innovation. Taken together, our data suggest that TEs have significantly and continuously shaped gene regulatory networks during mammalian evolution.},

Nevertheless, coding sequences for genes not expressed in a cell appear to be present in its nuclear RNA. Though many nuclear RNA transcripts of single copy DNA sequences are held in common between tissues, an additional set, probably consisting of non-message sequences, is not shared. Nuclear RNA also contains transcripts of repetitive DNA sequences. Certain repeat families are represented at high levels in the nuclear RNA of particular tissues and much lower levels in others. It is surprising that both complements of most repeat sequences are present in nuclear RNA. These observations lead to model for regulation of gene expression in which the formation of repetitive RNA-RNA duplexes controls the production of messenger RNA.},

   abstract = {Eukaryotic gene regulation is mediated by cis-regulatory elements, which are embedded within the vast non-coding genomic space and recognized by the transcription factors in a sequence- and context-dependent manner. A large proportion of eukaryotic genomes, including at least half of the human genome, are composed of transposable elements (TEs), which in their ancestral form carried their own cis-regulatory sequences able to exploit the host trans environment to promote TE transcription and facilitate transposition. Although not all present-day TE copies have retained this regulatory function, the preexisting regulatory potential of TEs can provide a rich source of cis-regulatory innovation for the host. Here, we review recent evidence documenting diverse contributions of TE sequences to gene regulation by functioning as enhancers, promoters, silencers and boundary elements. We discuss how TE-derived enhancer sequences can rapidly facilitate changes in existing gene regulatory networks and mediate species- and cell-type-specific regulatory innovations, and we postulate a unique contribution of TEs to species-specific gene expression divergence in pluripotency and early embryogenesis. With advances in genome-wide technologies and analyses, systematic investigation of TEs’ cis-regulatory potential is now possible and our understanding of the biological impact of genomic TEs is increasing.

   abstract = {Postnatal spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) progress through proliferative and developmental stages to populate the testicular niche prior to productive spermatogenesis. To better understand, we conducted extensive genomic profiling at multiple postnatal stages on subpopulations enriched for particular markers (THY1, KIT, OCT4, ID4, or GFRa1). Overall, our profiles suggest three broad populations of spermatogonia in juveniles: (1) epithelial-like spermatogonia (THY1 + ; high OCT4, ID4, and GFRa1), (2) more abundant mesenchymal-like spermatogonia (THY1 + ; moderate OCT4 and ID4; high mesenchymal markers), and (3) (in older juveniles) abundant spermatogonia committing to gametogenesis (high KIT +). Epithelial-like spermatogonia displayed the expected imprinting patterns, but, surprisingly, mesenchymal-like spermatogonia lacked imprinting specifically at paternally imprinted loci but fully restored imprinting prior to puberty. Furthermore, mesenchymal-like spermatogonia also displayed developmentally linked DNA demethylation at meiotic genes and also at certain monoallelic neural genes (e.g., protocad-herins and olfactory receptors). We also reveal novel candidate receptor-ligand networks involving SSCs and the developing niche. Taken together, neonates/juveniles contain heterogeneous epithelial-like or mesenchymal-like spermatogonial populations, with the latter displaying extensive DNA methylation/chromatin dynamics. We speculate that this plasticity helps SSCs proliferate and migrate within the developing seminiferous tubule, with proper niche interaction and membrane attachment reverting mesenchymal-like spermatogonial subtype cells back to an epithelial-like state with normal imprinting profiles.},

   abstract = {Spermatogenesis requires retinoic acid (RA) induction of the undifferentiated to differentiating transition in transit amplifying (TA) progenitor spermatogonia, whereas continuity of the spermatogenic lineage relies on the RA response being suppressed in spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). Here, we discovered that, in mouse testes, both spermatogonial populations possess intrinsic RA-response machinery and exhibit hallmarks of the differentiating transition following direct exposure to RA, including loss of SSC regenerative capacity. We determined that SSCs are only resistant to RA-driven differentiation when situated in the normal topological organization of the testis. Furthermore, we show that the soma is instrumental in “priming” TA progenitors for RA-induced differentiation through elevated RA receptor expression. Collectively, these findings indicate that SSCs and TA progenitor spermatogonia inhabit disparate niche microenvironments within seminiferous tubules that are critical for mediating extrinsic cues that drive fate decisions. Lord et al. have demonstrated that, contrary to previous assumptions, spermatogonial stem cells do express a functional complement of retinoic acid and retinoid X receptors (RARs/RXRs) and rely on protection from an undisturbed niche microenvironment to prevent loss of the spermatogenic reservoir to RA-induced differentiation.},

SG act as a protective mechanism to cope with acute stress, but persistent SG have cytotoxic effects that are associated with several age-related diseases. Here, we demonstrate that the testis-specific protein, MAGE-B2, increases cellular stress tolerance by suppressing SG formation through translational inhibition of the key SG nucleator G3BP. MAGE-B2 reduces G3BP protein levels below the critical concentration for phase separation and suppresses SG initiation. Importantly, knockout of the MAGE-B2 mouse ortholog confers hypersensitivity of the male germline to heat stress in vivo. Thus, MAGE-B2 provides cytoprotection to maintain mammalian spermatogenesis, a highly thermo-sensitive process that must be preserved throughout reproductive life. These results demonstrate a mechanism that allows for tissue-specific resistance against stress through fine-tuning phase separation and could aid in the development of male fertility therapies.},

We analyzed, from an evolutionary perspective, the binding regions of seven mammalian transcription factors (ESR1, TP53, MYC, RELA, POU5F1, SOX2, and CTCF) identified on a genome-wide scale by different chromatin immunoprecipitation approaches and found that only a minority of sites appear to be conserved at the sequence level. Instead, we uncovered a pervasive association with genomic repeats by showing that a large fraction of the bona fide binding sites for five of the seven transcription factors (ESR1, TP53, POU5F1, SOX2, and CTCF) are embedded in distinctive families of transposable elements. Using the age of the repeats, we established that these repeat-associated binding sites (RABS) have been associated with significant regulatory expansions throughout the mammalian phylogeny. We validated the functional significance of these RABS by showing that they are over-represented in proximity of regulated genes and that the binding motifs within these repeats have undergone evolutionary selection. Our results demonstrate that transcriptional regulatory networks are highly dynamic in eukaryotic genomes and that transposable elements play an important role in expanding the repertoire of binding sites. ©2008 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

While most ERVs are relics of ancient integration events, "young" proviruses competent for retrotransposition-found in many mammals, but not humans-represent an ongoing threat to host fitness. As a consequence, several restriction pathways have evolved to suppress their activity at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional stages of the viral life cycle. Nevertheless, accumulating evidence has revealed that LTR sequences derived from distantly related ERVs have been exapted as regulatory sequences for many host genes in a wide range of cell types throughout mammalian evolution. Here, we focus on emerging themes from recent studies cataloging the diversity of ERV LTRs acting as important transcriptional regulatory elements in mammals and explore the molecular features that likely account for LTR exaptation in developmental and tissue-specific gene regulation.},

   abstract = {The mammalian sperm genome is thought to lack substantial information for the regulation of future expression after fertilization. Here, we show that most promoters in mouse sperm are flanked by well-positioned nucleosomes marked by active histone modifications. Analysis of these modifications suggests that many enhancers and super-enhancers functional in embryonic and adult tissues are already specified in sperm. The sperm genome is bound by CTCF and cohesin at sites that are also present in round spermatids and embryonic stem cells (ESCs). These sites mediate interactions that organize the sperm genome into domains and compartments that overlap extensively with those found in mESCs. These results suggest that sperm carry a rich source of regulatory information, encoded in part by its three-dimensional folding specified by CTCF and cohesin. This information may contribute to future expression during embryonic and adult life, suggesting mechanisms by which environmental effects on the paternal germline are transmitted transgenerationally.},

   abstract = {The most highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) in mammalian genomes cluster within regions enriched for genes encoding developmentally important transcription factors (TFs). This suggests that HCNE-rich regions may contain key regulatory controls involved in development. We explored this by examining histone methylation in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells across 56 large HCNE-rich loci. We identified a specific modification pattern, termed "bivalent domains," consisting of large regions of H3 lysine 27 methylation harboring smaller regions of H3 lysine 4 methylation. Bivalent domains tend to coincide with TF genes expressed at low levels. We propose that bivalent domains silence developmental genes in ES cells while keeping them poised for activation. We also found striking correspondences between genome sequence and histone methylation in ES cells, which become notably weaker in differentiated cells. These results highlight the importance of DNA sequence in defining the initial epigenetic landscape and suggest a novel chromatin-based mechanism for maintaining pluripotency. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Here we reveal the molecular logic underlying the retention of nucleosomes in mouse spermatozoa, which contain only 1% residual histones. We observe high enrichment throughout the genome of nucleosomes at CpG-rich sequences that lack DNA methylation. Residual nucleosomes are largely composed of the histone H3.3 variant and are trimethylated at Lys4 of histone H3 (H3K4me3). Canonical H3.1 and H3.2 histones are also enriched at CpG-rich promoters marked by Polycomb-mediated H3K27me3, a modification predictive of gene repression in preimplantation embryos. Histone variant-specific nucleosome retention in sperm is strongly associated with nucleosome turnover in round spermatids. Our data show evolutionary conservation of the basic principles of nucleosome retention in mouse and human sperm, supporting a model of epigenetic inheritance by nucleosomes between generations.},

   abstract = {Self-renewal and differentiation by spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) is the foundation for continual spermatogenesis. SSC self-renewal is dependent on glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF); however, intracellular mechanisms stimulated by GDNF in SSCs are unknown. To investigate these mechanisms we utilized a culture system that maintains a mouse undifferentiated germ cell population enriched for self-renewing SSCs. In these cultures mRNA for the transcription factors Bcl6b, Erm, and Lhx1 are up-regulated by GDNF and decreased in its absence. The expression of all three molecules was further identified in undifferentiated spermatogonia in vivo. Using small interfering RNA to reduce expression and transplantation to quantify stem cell numbers, Bcl6b, Erm, and Lhx1 were shown to be important for SSC maintenance in vitro. Next, GDNF was shown to activate both Akt and Src family kinase (SFK) signaling in SSCs, and culture of SSCs with inhibitors to Akt or SFKs followed by transplantation analysis showed significant impairment of SSC maintenance in vitro. Apoptosis analysis revealed a significant increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells when Akt, but not SFK, signaling was impaired, indicating that multiple signaling pathways are responsible for SSC self-renewal and survival. Biochemical and gene expression experiments revealed that GDNF up-regulated expression of Bcl6b, Erm, and Lhx1 transcripts is dependent on SFK signaling. Overall, these data demonstrate that GDNF up-regulation of Bcl6b, Erm, and Lhx1 expression through SFK signaling is a key component of the intracellular mechanism for SSC self-renewal. © 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

   abstract = {In mammalian testes, spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) maintain spermatogenesis over a long period of time by undergoing self-renewal and differentiation. SSCs are among the most primitive of spermatogenic cells (undifferentiated spermatogonia), and their activities are strictly regulated by extrinsic niche factors. However, the factors that constitute a testicular niche remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling maintains undifferentiated spermatogonia through activating ERK1/2 signaling in vivo. Undifferentiated spermatogonia comprise GFRA1<sup>+</sup> and NANOS3<sup>+</sup> subpopulations, which are likely to undergo self-renewal and enter the differentiation pathway, respectively. In the testis, Fgfr1 was expressed in the entire population of undifferentiated spermatogonia, and deleting FGFR1 in spermatogenic cells partially inactivated ERK1/2 and resulted in reduced numbers of both GFRA1<sup>+</sup> and NANOS3<sup>+</sup> cells. In addition, Fgf8 was expressed in spermatogenic cells, and loss- and gain-of-function models of FGF8 demonstrated that FGF8 positively regulated the numbers of undifferentiated spermatogonia through FGFR1, particularly among NANOS3<sup>+</sup> cells. Finally we show a possible involvement of FGF signaling in the reversion from NANOS3<sup>+</sup> into GFRA1<sup>+</sup> undifferentiated spermatogonia. Taken together, our data suggest that FGF signaling is an important component of the testicular niche and has a unique function for maintaining undifferentiated spermatogonia.},

   abstract = {Background: The assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq) is a powerful method to examine chromatin accessibility. While many studies have reported a positive correlation between gene expression and promoter accessibility, few have investigated the genes that deviate from this trend. In this study, we aimed to understand the relationship between gene expression and promoter accessibility in multiple cell types while also identifying gene regulatory networks in the placenta, an understudied organ that is critical for a successful pregnancy. Results: We started by assaying the open chromatin landscape in the mid-gestation placenta, when the fetal vasculature has started developing. After incorporating transcriptomic data generated in the placenta at the same time point, we grouped genes based on their expression levels and ATAC-seq promoter coverage. We found that the genes with the strongest correlation (high expression and high coverage) are likely involved in housekeeping functions, whereas tissue-specific genes were highly expressed and had only medium-low coverage. We also predicted that genes with medium-low expression and high promoter coverage were actively repressed. Within this group, we extracted a protein-protein interaction network enriched for neuronal functions, likely preventing the cells from adopting a neuronal fate. We further confirmed that a repressive histone mark is bound to the promoters of genes in this network. Finally, we ran our pipeline using ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data generated in ten additional cell types. We again found that genes with the strongest correlation are enriched for housekeeping functions and that genes with medium-low promoter coverage and high expression are more likely to be tissue-specific. These results demonstrate that only two data types, both of which require relatively low starting material to generate and are becoming more commonly available, can be integrated to understand multiple aspects of gene regulation. Conclusions: Within the placenta, we identified an active placenta-specific gene network as well as a repressed neuronal network. Beyond the placenta, we demonstrate that ATAC-seq data and RNA-seq data can be integrated to identify tissue-specific genes and actively repressed gene networks in multiple cell types.},

   abstract = {The double bromodomain-containing BET (bromodomain and extra terminal) family of proteins is highly conserved from yeast to humans and consists not just of transcriptional regulators but also histone-interacting chromatin remodelers. The four mammalian BET genes are each expressed at unique times during spermatogenesis, and the testis-specific gene Brdt is essential for spermatogenesis. Loss of the first bromodomain of BRDT results in improper/incomplete spermatid elongation and severely morphologically defective sperm. The elongation defects observed in mutant spermatids can be directly tied to altered postmeiotic chromatin architecture. BRDT is required for creation/maintenance of the chromocenter of round spermatids, a structure that forms just after completion of meiosis. The chromocenter creates a defined topology in spermatids, and the presence of multiple chromocenters rather than a single intact chromocenter correlates with loss of spermatid polarity, loss of heterochromatin foci at the nuclear envelope, and loss of proper spermatid elongation. BRDT is not only essential for proper chromatin organization but also involved in regulation of transcription and in cotranscriptional processing. That is, transcription and alternative splicing are altered in spermatocytes and spermatids that lack full-length BRDT. Additionally, the transcription of mRNAs with short 3' UTRs, which is characteristic of round spermatids, is also altered. Examination of the genes regulated by BRDT yields many possible targets that could in part explain the morphologically abnormal sperm produced by the BRDT mutant testes. Thus, BRDT and possibly the other BET genes are required for proper spermatogenesis, which opens up the possibility that the recently discovered small molecule inhibitors of the BET family could be useful as reversible male contraceptives. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) plays a crucial role in regulating the proliferation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSC). The signaling pathways mediating the function of GDNF in SSC remain unclear. This study was designed to determine whether GDNF signals via the Ras/ERK1/2 pathway in the C18-4 cells, a mouse SSC line. The identity of this cell line was confirmed by the expression of various markers for germ cells, proliferating spermatogonia, and SSC, including GCNA1, Vasa, Dazl, PCNA, Oct-4, GFRalpha1, Ret, and Plzf. Western blot analysis revealed that GDNF activated Ret tyrosine phosphorylation. All 3 isoforms of Shc were phosphorylated upon GDNF stimulation, and GDNF induced the binding of the phosphorylated Ret to Shc and Grb2 as indicated by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. The active Ras was induced by GDNF, which further activated ERK1/2 phosphorylation. GDNF stimulated the phosphorylation of CREB-1, ATF-1, and CREM-1, and c-fos transcription. Notably, the increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation, c-fos transcription, bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, and metaphase counts induced by GDNF, was completely blocked by pretreatment with PD98059, a specific inhibitor for MEK1, the upstream regulator of ERK1/2. GDNF stimulation eventually upregulated cyclin A and CDK2 expression. Together, these data suggest that GDNF induces CREB/ATF-1 family member phosphorylation and c-fos transcription via the Ras/ERK1/2 pathway to promote the proliferation of SSC. Unveiling GDNF signaling cascades in SSC has important implications in providing attractive targets for male contraception as well as for the regulation of stem cell renewal vs. differentiation.},

Recently, a germ-cell-specific organelle, nuage, was proposed to play a role in transposon repression. To test this hypothesis, we disrupted a murine homolog of a Drosophila nuage protein Maelstrom. Effects on male meiotic chromosome synapsis and derepression of transposable elements (TEs) were observed. In the adult Mael-/- testes, LINE-1 (L1) derepression occurred at the onset of meiosis. As a result, Mael-/- spermatocytes were flooded with L1 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) that accumulated in large cytoplasmic enclaves and nuclei. Mael-/- spermatocytes with nuclear L1 RNPs exhibited massive DNA damage and severe chromosome asynapsis even in the absence of SPO11-generated meiotic double-strand breaks. This study demonstrates that MAEL, a nuage component, is indispensable for the silencing of TEs and identifies the initiation of meiosis as an important step in TE control in the male germline. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Drosophila spermatogenesis has become a paradigmatic system for the study of mechanisms that regulate adult stem cell maintenance, proliferation and differentiation. The dramatic cellular differentiation process from germline stem cell (GSC) to mature sperm is accompanied by dynamic changes in gene expression, which are regulated at transcriptional, post-transcriptional (including translational) and post-translational levels. Post-transcriptional regulation has been proposed as a unique feature of germ cells. However, recent studies have provided new insights into transcriptional regulation during Drosophila spermatogenesis. Both signaling pathways and epigenetic mechanisms act to orchestrate the transcriptional regulation of distinct genes at different germ cell differentiation stages. Many of the regulatory pathways that control male gamete differentiation in Drosophila are conserved in mammals. Therefore, studies using Drosophila spermatogenesis will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms that regulate mammalian germ cell differentiation pathways.},

A comprehensive reference of ATAC-seq datasets for mammalian tissues is important for the understanding of regulatory specificity and developmental abnormality caused by genetic or environmental alterations. Here, we report an adult mouse ATAC-seq atlas by producing a total of 66 ATAC-seq profiles from 20 primary tissues of both male and female mice. The ATAC-seq read enrichment, fragment size distribution, and reproducibility between replicates demonstrated the high quality of the full dataset. We identified a total of 296,574 accessible elements, of which 26,916 showed tissue-specific accessibility. Further, we identified key transcription factors specific to distinct tissues and found that the enrichment of each motif reflects the developmental similarities across tissues. In summary, our study provides an important resource on the mouse epigenome and will be of great importance to various scientific disciplines such as development, cell reprogramming, and genetic disease.},

However, the functional importance of individual miRs in controlling spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) homeostasis has not been investigated. Using high-throughput sequencing, we profiled the expression of miRs in the Thy1 + testis cell population, which is highly enriched for SSCs, and the Thy1 - cell population, composed primarily of testis somatic cells. In addition, we profiled the global expression of miRs in cultured germ cells, also enriched for SSCs. Our results demonstrate that miR-21, along with miR-34c, -182, -183, and -146a, are preferentially expressed in the Thy1 +SSC-enriched population, compared with Thy1 - somatic cells. Importantly, we demonstrate that transient inhibition of miR-21 in SSC-enriched germ cell cultures increased the number of germ cells undergoing apoptosis and significantly reduced the number of donor-derived colonies of spermatogenesis formed from transplanted treated cells in recipient mouse testes, indicating that miR-21 is important in maintaining the SSC population. Moreover, we show that in SSC-enriched germ cell cultures, miR-21 is regulated by the transcription factor ETV5, known to be critical for SSC self-renewal.},

   abstract = {Background: The germline serves as a conduit for transmission of genetic and epigenetic information from one generation to the next. In males, spermatozoa are the final carriers of inheritance and their continual production is supported by a foundational population of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) that forms from prospermatogonial precursors during the early stages of neonatal development. In mammals, the timing for which SSCs are specified and the underlying mechanisms guiding this process remain to be completely understood. Objectives: To propose an evolving concept for how the foundational SSC population is established. Materials and methods: This review summarizes recent and historical findings from peer-reviewed publications made primarily with mouse models while incorporating limited studies from humans and livestock. Results and conclusion: Establishment of the SSC population appears to follow a biphasic pattern involving a period of fate programming followed by an establishment phase that culminates in formation of the SSC population. This model for establishment of the foundational SSC population from precursors is anticipated to extend across mammalian species and include humans and livestock, albeit on different timescales.},

   abstract = {Background: Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are ancient sequences integrated in the germ line cells and vertically transmitted through the offspring constituting about 8 % of our genome. In time, HERVs accumulated mutations that compromised their coding capacity. A prominent exception is HERV-W locus 7q21.2, producing a functional Env protein (Syncytin-1) coopted for placental syncytiotrophoblast formation. While expression of HERV-W sequences has been investigated for their correlation to disease, an exhaustive description of the group composition and characteristics is still not available and current HERV-W group information derive from studies published a few years ago that, of course, used the rough assemblies of the human genome available at that time. This hampers the comparison and correlation with current human genome assemblies. Results: In the present work we identified and described in detail the distribution and genetic composition of 213 HERV-W elements. The bioinformatics analysis led to the characterization of several previously unreported features and provided a phylogenetic classification of two main subgroups with different age and structural characteristics. New facts on HERV-W genomic context of insertion and co-localization with sequences putatively involved in disease development are also reported. Conclusions: The present work is a detailed overview of the HERV-W contribution to the human genome and provides a robust genetic background useful to clarify HERV-W role in pathologies with poorly understood etiology, representing, to our knowledge, the most complete and exhaustive HERV-W dataset up to date.},

   abstract = {Little is known of the molecular mechanisms whereby spermatogonia, mitotic germ cells of the testis, self-renew and differentiate into sperm 1,2. Here we show that Zfp145, encoding the transcriptional repressor Plzf, has a crucial role in spermatogenesis. Zfp145 expression was restricted to gonocytes and undifferentiated spermatogonia and was absent in tubules of W/W v mutants that lack these cells. Mice lacking Zfp145 underwent a progressive loss of spermatogonia with age, associated with increases in apoptosis and subsequent loss of tubule structure but without overt differentiation defects or loss of the supporting Sertoli cells. Spermatogonial transplantation experiments revealed a depletion of spermatogonial stem cells in the adult. Microarray analysis of isolated spermatogonia from Zfp145-null mice before testis degeneration showed alterations in the expression profile of genes associated with spermatogenesis. These results identify Plzf as a spermatogonia-specific transcription factor in the testis that is required to regulate self-renewal and maintenance of the stem cell pool. Figure 1 Expression of Zfp145 in the developing testis. (a) Immuno-histochemistry with an antibody to Plzf on sections from the embryonic genital ridge at E13.5 and E17.5 and on the developing postnatal testis (at 1, 2 and 3 weeks). Expression of Plzf was first detected in the germ cells at E17.5 during development and peaked at around 1 week postnatal. Plzf expression was localized to the spermatogonia and Plzf-positive cells became progressively sparser in the seminiferous tubules with age. Insets show higher magnifications of the basal spermatogonia layer. Tubules from the W/W v mouse that did not contain spermatogonia lacked expression of Plzf.

For decades, it has been known that this several-weeks-long process involves a series of highly ordered and morphologically recognizable cellular changes as spermatogonia proliferate, sperma-tocytes undertake meiosis, and spermatids develop condensed nuclei, acrosomes, and flagella. Yet, much of the underlying molecular logic driving these processes has remained opaque because conventional characterization strategies often aggregated groups of cells to meet technical requirements or due to limited capability for cell selection. Recently, a cornucopia of single-cell transcriptome studies has begun to lift the veil on the full compendium of gene expression phenotypes and changes underlying spermatogenic development. These datasets have revealed the previously obscured molecular heterogeneity among and between varied spermatogenic cell types and are reinvigorating investigation of testicular biology.

Localization of selected proteins including ADAM20 and ADAM29 (post-acrosomal cell-surface proteins), ACRV1 (intra-acrosomal secreted protein) and AKAP4 (sperm tail-specific protein) was confirmed by immunofluorescence in testic-ular and mature spermatozoa. Acrosome-specific protein ACRV1 was evaluated by ELISA in seminal plasma and spermatozoa, and emerged as a non-invasive biomarker to evaluate acrosome integrity.

DESIGN: Single sperm morphological parameters (such as sperm head size, aspect ratio, circularity, middle piece width, etc.) and DNA fragmentation index (DFI) were obtained from differential interference contrast (DIC) and fluorescence images, respectively. A linear model was used to analyze the relationship between sperm morphology with DNA integrity for single sperm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sperm samples were prepared by a non-destructive drying method. Raw semen sample after washing were seeded onto a hyaluronic acid (HA) modified glass cover slide, followed by air-drying and Acridine Orange (AO) staining.[1] Images of identical sperms under DIC and fluorescence mode were obtained with laser-scanning confocal mi-croscopy. Analysis of variance was conducted in JMP software with DFI as the response variable. RESULTS: Our method of sperm sample preparation allows sperm imaging with high efficiency and quality, especially for protocols requiring multi-step staining. The preliminary results from 200 sperms reveal that there is a significant correlation between sperm head area and DNA integrity. Other sperm morphological parameters, such as head aspect ratio and circularity, are also correlated with sperm DFI. CONCLUSIONS: The study of sperm morphology and DNA integrity suggests that sperm morphology and DNA integrity is correlated at a single cell level.},

   abstract = {Through the use of donor cells from transgenic rats expressing GFP exclusively in the germline, we have defined culture conditions where male germ cells lose (on STO cells) or maintain (on MSC-1 cells) stem cell activity. A cadre of germ cell transcripts strikingly decrease in relative abundance as a function of testis age or culture time on STO cells, but only a subset of these transcripts (approximately 248) remain elevated when cultured on MSC-1 cells. If specific gene expression regulates stem cell activity, some or all of these transcripts are candidates as such regulators. We establish a spermatogonial stem cell index (SSCI) that reliably predicts relative stem cell activity in rat or mouse testis cell cultures, and through the use of an antibody to a robust signal (Egr3) within the index find intense signals in single or paired cells. As germ cells form longer interconnected chains (incomplete cytokinesis), the Egr3 signal disappears coincident with a loss of stem cell activity. Thus, molecular markers specific for spermatogonial stem cells establish a reliable and rapid means by which to define these cells in culture and alleviate the need for laborious testicular transfers in initial cell culture studies. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

However, the roles ubiquitous factors play in the specification of cell identity remain underappreciated. Here we show that the ubiquitous CCAAT-binding NF-Y complex is required for the maintenance ofembryonic stem cell (ESC) identity and is an essential component of the core pluripotency network. Genome-wide studies in ESCs and neurons reveal that NF-Y regulates not only genes with housekeeping functions through cell type-invariant promoter-proximal binding, but also genes required for cell identity by binding to cell type-specific enhancers with master TFs. Mechanistically, NF-Y's distinct DNA-binding mode promotes master/pioneer TF binding at enhancers by facilitating a permissive chromatin conformation. Our studies unearth a conceptually unique function for histone-fold domain (HFD) protein NF-Y in promoting chromatin accessibility and suggest that other HFD proteins with analogous structural and DNA-binding properties may function in similar ways.},

NF-Y is composed of the NF-YA and NF-YB/NF-YC subunits, the latter two hosting histone-fold domains (HFDs). The crystal structure of NF-Y bound to a 25 bp CCAAT oligonucleotide shows that the HFD dimer binds to the DNA sugar-phosphate backbone, mimicking the nucleosome H2A/H2B-DNA assembly. NF-YA both binds to NF-YB/NF-YC and inserts an α helix deeply into the DNA minor groove, providing sequence-specific contacts to the CCAAT box. Structural considerations and mutational data indicate that NF-YB ubiquitination at Lys138 precedes and is equivalent to H2B Lys120 monoubiquitination, important in transcriptional activation. Thus, NF-Y is a sequence-specific transcription factor with nucleosome-like properties of nonspecific DNA binding and helps establish permissive chromatin modifications at CCAAT promoters.

Here, we demonstrate in macrophages and B cells that collaborative interactions of the common factor PU.1 with small sets of macrophage- or B cell lineage-determining transcription factors establish cell-specific binding sites that are associated with the majority of promoter-distal H3K4me1-marked genomic regions. PU.1 binding initiates nucleosome remodeling, followed by H3K4 monomethylation at large numbers of genomic regions associated with both broadly and specifically expressed genes. These locations serve as beacons for additional factors, exemplified by liver X receptors, which drive both cell-specific gene expression and signal-dependent responses. Together with analyses of transcription factor binding and H3K4me1 patterns in other cell types, these studies suggest that simple combinations of lineage-determining transcription factors can specify the genomic sites ultimately responsible for both cell identity and cell type-specific responses to diverse signaling inputs. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we report the production and characterization of the Rfx2 knockout mice. The male knockout mice were sterile due to the arrest of spermatogenesis at an early round spermatid step. The Rfx2-null round spermatids detached from the seminiferous tubules, forming large multinucleated giant cells that underwent apoptosis. In the mutants, formation of the flagellum was inhibited at its earliest stage. RNA-seq analysis identified a large number of cilia-related genes and testis-specific genes that were regulated by RFX2.

Here, using a phenotyping approach in Fxrα−/− mice, we describe unexpected roles of FXRα on germ cell physiology independent of its effects on somatic cells. FXRα helps establish and maintain an undifferentiated germ cell pool and in turn influences male fertility. FXRα regulates the expression of several pluripotency factors. Among these, in vitro approaches show that FXRα controls the expression of the pluripotency marker Lin28 in the germ cells.},

Points of interest are the different changes in the ligand-binding pocket induced by variously shaped agonists, the communication of the ligand-bound pocket with the coactivator binding surface and the heterodimerization interface, and recently identified ligands that are natural products, those that function as environmental toxins or drugs that had been originally designed to interact with other targets, as well as those that were deliberately designed as RXR-selective transcriptional agonists, synergists, or antagonists. Of these synthetic ligands, the general trend in design appears to be away from fully aromatic rigid structures to those containing partial elements of the flexible tetraene side chain of 9-cis-retinoic acid.

NRs sense changes in lipid metabolite levels to drive differential gene expression, producing distinct physiologic effects. This is an allosteric process whereby binding a cognate ligand and specific DNA sequences drives the recruitment of diverse transcriptional co-regulators at chromatin and ultimately transactivation or transrepression of target genes. Dysregulation of NR signaling leads to various malignances, metabolic disorders, and inflammatory disease. Given their important role in physiology and ability to respond to small lipophilic ligands, NRs have emerged as valuable therapeutic targets. Here, we summarize and discuss the recent progress on understanding the complex mechanism of action of NRs, primarily from a structural perspective. Finally, we suggest future studies to improve our understanding of NR signaling and better design drugs by integrating multiple structural and biophysical approaches.},

We explored this by generating time-resolved transcriptomes and epigenome profiles during oncogenic RAS-induced senescence and validating central findings in different cell biology and disease models of senescence.

   abstract = {Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) plays a crucial role in regulating the proliferation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSC). The signaling pathways mediating the function of GDNF in SSC remain unclear. This study was designed to determine whether GDNF signals via the Ras/ERK1/2 pathway in the C18-4 cells, a mouse SSC line. The identity of this cell line was confirmed by the expression of various markers for germ cells, proliferating spermatogonia, and SSC, including GCNA1, Vasa, Dazl, PCNA, Oct-4, GFRalpha1, Ret, and Plzf. Western blot analysis revealed that GDNF activated Ret tyrosine phosphorylation. All 3 isoforms of Shc were phosphorylated upon GDNF stimulation, and GDNF induced the binding of the phosphorylated Ret to Shc and Grb2 as indicated by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. The active Ras was induced by GDNF, which further activated ERK1/2 phosphorylation. GDNF stimulated the phosphorylation of CREB-1, ATF-1, and CREM-1, and c-fos transcription. Notably, the increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation, c-fos transcription, bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, and metaphase counts induced by GDNF, was completely blocked by pretreatment with PD98059, a specific inhibitor for MEK1, the upstream regulator of ERK1/2. GDNF stimulation eventually upregulated cyclin A and CDK2 expression. Together, these data suggest that GDNF induces CREB/ATF-1 family member phosphorylation and c-fos transcription via the Ras/ERK1/2 pathway to promote the proliferation of SSC. Unveiling GDNF signaling cascades in SSC has important implications in providing attractive targets for male contraception as well as for the regulation of stem cell renewal vs. differentiation.},

A hierarchical model was established, which was characterized by the sequential and stepwise development of three spermatogonia subtypes, seven spermatocyte subtypes, and four spermatid subtypes. Further analysis identified several stage-specific marker genes of human germ cells, such as HMGA1, PIWIL4, TEX29, SCML1, and CCDC112. Moreover, we identified altered gene expression patterns in the testicular somatic cells of one NOA patient via scRNA-seq analysis, paving the way for further diagnosis of male infertility. Our work allows for the reconstruction of transcriptional programs inherent to sequential cell fate transition during human spermatogenesis and has implications for deciphering male-related reproductive disorders. Single-cell RNA sequencing of 2,854 testicular cells reveals critical biological features of the sequential and stepwise development of spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and spermatids during human spermatogenesis.

Complementing this negative regulation is positive regulation conferred by four androgen-response elements (AREs) that interact with the androgen receptor (AR), a nuclear hormone receptor expressed at high levels in Sertoli cells. A third control mechanism is provided by a consensus GATA-binding site that is crucial for Pp transcription both in vitro and in vivo. Several lines of evidence suggested that GATA factors and AR act cooperatively to activate Pp transcription: (i) the GATA-binding site crucial for Pp transcription is in close proximity to two of the AREs, (ii) GATA and AR form a complex with the Pp in vitro, (iii) overexpression of GATA factors rescued expression from mutant Pp constructs harboring defective AREs, and (iv) incubation of a Sertoli cell line with testosterone triggered corecruitment of AR and GATA4 to the Pp . Collectively, our results suggest that the Rhox5 gene achieves Sertoli cell-specific transcription using a combinatorial strategy involving negative and cooperative positive regulation. },

   abstract = {Spermatogenesis is a multistep process that generates millions of spermatozoa per day in mammals. A key to this process is the spermatogonial stem cell (SSC), which has the dual property of continually renewing and undergoing differentiation into a spermatogonial progenitor that expands and further differentiates. In this review, we will focus on how these proliferative and early differentiation steps in mammalian male germ cells are controlled by transcription factors. Most of the transcription factors that have so far been identified as promoting SSC self-renewal (BCL6B, BRACHYURY, ETV5, ID4, LHX1, and POU3F1) are upregulated by glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Since GDNF is crucial for promoting SSC self-renewal, this suggests that these transcription factors are responsible for coordinating the action of GDNF in SSCs. Other transcription factors that promote SSC self-renewal are expressed independently of GDNF (FOXO1, PLZF, POU5F1, and TAF4B) and thus may act in non-GDNF pathways to promote SSC cell growth or survival. Several transcription factors have been identified that promote spermatogonial differentiation (DMRT1, NGN3, SOHLH1, SOHLH2, SOX3, and STAT3); some of these may influence the decision of an SSC to commit to differentiate while others may promote later spermatogonial differentiation steps. Many of these transcription factors regulate each other and act on common targets, suggesting they integrate to form complex transcriptional networks in self-renewing and differentiating spermatogonia. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Some of them also regulate apoptosis-related genes. Several Ets family proteins are preferentially expressed in specific cell lineages and are involved in their development and differentiation by increasing the enhancer or promoter activities of the genes encoding growth factor receptors and integrin families specific for the cell lineages. Many Ets family proteins also modulate gene expression through protein-protein interactions with other cellular partners. Deregulated expression or formation of chimeric fusion proteins of Ets family due to proviral insertion or chromosome translocation is associated with leukemias and specific types of solid tumors.

Here we characterize an Ets-family member, the very specifically expressed human Fifth Ewing Variant (FEV), as a transcriptional repressor. We show that among a broad range of human cell lines, only Dami megakaryocytic cells express FEV. This nuclear protein binds to Ets-binding sites, such as that of the human ICAM-1 promoter. We used this promoter to demonstrate that FEV can repress both basal transcription and, even more strongly, ectopically Ets-activated transcription. We identified two domains responsible for FEV-mediated repression: the ETS domain, responsible for passive repression, and the carboxy-terminal alanine-rich domain, involved in active repression. In the Ets-independent LEXA system also, FEV acts as a transcriptional repressor via its alanine-rich carboxy-terminal domain. The mechanism by which FEV actively represses transcription is currently unknown, since FEV-triggered repression is not reversed by the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. We also showed that long-term overexpression of FEV proteins containing the alanine-rich domain prevents cell clones from growing, whereas clones expressing a truncated FEV protein lacking this domain develop like control cells. This confirms the importance of this domain in FEV-triggered repression.},

Trans-membrane 203 (TMEM203) was identified here in cDNA overexpression screens for proteins capable of modulating intracellular calcium levels using activation of a calcium/calcineurin regulated transcription factor as an indicator. Overexpression of TMEM203 resulted in a reduction of Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) calcium stores and elevation in basal cytoplasmic calcium levels. TMEM203 protein was localized to the ER and found associated with a number of ER proteins which regulate ER calcium entry and efflux. Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from Tmem203 deficient mice had reduced ER calcium stores and altered calcium homeostasis. Tmem203 deficient mice were viable though male knockout mice were infertile and exhibited a severe block in spermiogenesis and spermiation. Expression profiling studies showed significant alternations in expression of calcium channels and pumps in testes and concurrently Tmem203 deficient spermatocytes demonstrated significantly altered calcium handling. Thus Tmem203 is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of cellular calcium homeostasis, is required for spermatogenesis and provides a causal link between intracellular calcium regulation and spermiogenesis.},

Recently, numerous studies suggested that dietary flavanones exhibit neuroprotective and antidepressant effects against various psycho-physiological conditions including depression. The present study is focused on the antidepressant and neuroprotective effects of naringenin (NAR) and the involvement of sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling in the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression. Twenty-four male Wistar rats were randomly assigned into four groups: CON group (saline s.c.), NAR group (NAR 50 mg/kg, p.o.), CUMS group (subjected to CUMS along with saline p.o.), and CUMS + NAR group (NAR 50 mg/kg p.o. along with CUMS) for 28 days including 1-week pre-treatment with NAR. The results showed that NAR was found to inhibit behavioral abnormalities including increased despair in force swim test, and reduced locomotor activity caused by CUMS in open field test. Moreover, Morris water maze revealed that NAR also mitigates CUMS-associated cognitive impairment. In addition to the antidepressant-like effect, NAR mitigates morphological anomalies in the hippocampal CA1 region and cortex. Furthermore, we observed brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), Shh, GLI1, NKX2.2, and PAX6 were downregulated in the hippocampus of CUMS-exposed rats, which can be upregulated by NAR pre-treatment. GLI1 is main downstream signaling component of Shh signaling cascade, which further regulates the expression of homeodomain transcription factors PAX6 and NKX2.2.},

   abstract = {RNA splicing entails the coordinated interaction of more than 150 proteins in the spliceosome, one of the most complex of the cell's molecular machines. We previously discovered that the RNA-binding motif protein 17 (RBM17), a component of the spliceosome, is essential for survival and cell maintenance. Here, we find that it interacts with the spliceosomal factors U2SURP and CHERP and that they reciprocally regulate each other's stability, both in mouse and in human cells. Individual knockdown of each of the three proteins induces overlapping changes in splicing and gene expression of transcripts enriched for RNA-processing factors. Our results elucidate the function of RBM17, U2SURP, and CHERP and link the activity of the spliceosome to the regulation of downstream RNA-binding proteins. These data support the hypothesis that, beyond driving constitutive splicing, spliceosomal factors can regulate alternative splicing of specific targets. De Maio et al. find that the splicing factor RBM17 establishes a physical and functional relation with U2SURP and CHERP. Knockdown of these U2 snRNP-associated spliceosomal components reveals their synergistic activity toward regulation of a given set of transcripts rather than a more predictable transcriptome-wide inhibition of splicing.},

Interestingly, highly pervasive H3K27me3 is found in regions depleted of transcription and DNA methylation in oocytes. Unexpectedly, we observed extensive loss of promoter H3K27me3 at Hox and other developmental genes upon fertilization. This is accompanied by global erasure of sperm H3K27me3 but inheritance of distal H3K27me3 from oocytes. The resulting allele-specific H3K27me3 patterns persist to blastocysts before being converted to canonical forms in postimplantation embryos, where both H3K4me3/H3K27me3 bivalent promoter marks are restored at developmental genes.

   abstract = {Combinations of post-translational histone modifications shape the chromatin landscape during cell development in eukaryotes. However, little is known about the modifications exactly delineating functionally engaged regulatory elements. For example, although histone H3 lysine 4 mono-methylation (H3K4me1) indicates the presence of transcriptional gene enhancers, it does not provide clearcut information about their actual position and stage-specific activity. Histone marks were, therefore, studied here at genomic loci differentially expressed in early stages of T-lymphocyte development. The concomitant presence of the three H3K4 methylation states (H3K4me1/2/3) was found to clearly reflect the activity of bona fide T-cell gene enhancers. Globally, gain or loss of H3K4me2/3 at distal genomic regions correlated with, respectively, the induction or the repression of associated genes during T-cell development. In the Tcrb gene enhancer, the H3K4me3-to-H3K4me1 ratio decreases with the enhancer's strength. Lastly, enhancer association of RNA-polymerase II (Pol II) correlated with the presence of H3K4me3 and Pol II accumulation resulted in local increase of H3K4me3. Our results suggest the existence of functional links between Pol II occupancy, H3K4me3 enrichment and enhancer activity. © 2011 European Molecular Biology Organization | All Rights Reserved.},

   abstract = {Background: Epigenetic modifications have a central role in transcriptional regulation. While several studies using next-generation sequencing have revealed genome-wide associations between epigenetic modifications and transcriptional states, a direct causal relationship at specific genomic loci has not been fully demonstrated, due to a lack of technology for targeted manipulation of epigenetic modifications. Recently, epigenome editing techniques based on the CRISPR-Cas9 system have been reported to directly manipulate specific modifications at precise genomic regions. However, the number of editable modifications as well as studies applying these techniques in vivo is still limited. Results: Here, we report direct modification of the epigenome in medaka (Japanese killifish, Oryzias latipes) embryos. Specifically, we developed a method to ectopically induce the repressive histone modification, H3K27me3 in a locus-specific manner, using a fusion construct of Oryzias latipes H3K27 methyltransferase Ezh2 (olEzh2) and dCas9 (dCas9-olEzh2). Co-injection of dCas9-olEzh2 mRNA with single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) into one-cell-stage embryos induced specific H3K27me3 accumulation at the targeted loci and induced downregulation of gene expression. Conclusion: In this study, we established the in vivo epigenome editing of H3K27me3 using medaka embryos. The locus-specific manipulation of the epigenome in living organisms will lead to a previously inaccessible understanding of the role of epigenetic modifications in development and disease.},

Features that delineate these cell types are undefined for many lineages, including spermato-genesis, which is supported by an undifferentiated spermatogonial population. Here, we generated a transgenic mouse line in which spermatogonial stem cells are marked by expression of an inhibitor of differentiation 4 (Id4)-green fluorescent protein (Gfp) transgene. We found that Id4-Gfp+ cells exist primarily as a subset of the type Asingle pool, and their frequency is greatest in neonatal development and then decreases in proportion during establishment of the spermatogenic lineage, eventually comprising ~ 2% of the undifferentiated spermatogonial population in adulthood. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that expression of 11 and 25 genes is unique for the Id4-Gfp+/stem cell and Id4-Gfp-/progenitor fractions, respectively. Collectively, these findings provide the first definitive evidence that stem cells exist as a rare subset of the Asingle pool and reveal transcriptome features distinguishing stem cell and progenitor states within the mammalian male germline. © 2014 Chan et al.},

Here we used an Id4-eGfp reporter mouse to discover that EGFP intensity is predictive of the subsets, with the ID4-EGFP Bright population being mostly, if not purely, SSCs, whereas the ID4-EGFP Dim population is in transition to the progenitor state. These subsets are also distinguishable by transcriptome signatures. Moreover, using a conditional overexpression mouse model, we found that transition from the stem cell to the immediate progenitor state requires downregulation of Id4 coincident with a major change in the transcriptome.

Whether chromatin accessibility can be assessed in complex, dynamic systems in vivo with high sensitivity remains largely unexplored. In this study, we use ATAC-seq to identify chromatin accessibility changes in a whole animal, the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, from embryogenesis to adulthood. Chromatin accessibility changes between developmental stages are highly reproducible, recapitulate histone modification changes, and reveal key regulatory aspects of the epigenomic landscape throughout organismal development. We find that over 5000 distal noncoding regions exhibit dynamic changes in chromatin accessibility between developmental stages and could thereby represent putative enhancers. When tested in vivo, several of these putative enhancers indeed drive novel cell-type- and temporal-specific patterns of expression. Finally, by integrating transcription factor binding motifs in a machine learning framework, we identify EOR-1 as a unique transcription factor that may regulate chromatin dynamics during development. Our study provides a unique resource for C. elegans, a system in which the prevalence and importance of enhancers remains poorly characterized, and demonstrates the power of using whole organism chromatin accessibility to identify novel regulatory regions in complex systems.},

   abstract = {Background: The assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq) is a powerful method to examine chromatin accessibility. While many studies have reported a positive correlation between gene expression and promoter accessibility, few have investigated the genes that deviate from this trend. In this study, we aimed to understand the relationship between gene expression and promoter accessibility in multiple cell types while also identifying gene regulatory networks in the placenta, an understudied organ that is critical for a successful pregnancy. Results: We started by assaying the open chromatin landscape in the mid-gestation placenta, when the fetal vasculature has started developing. After incorporating transcriptomic data generated in the placenta at the same time point, we grouped genes based on their expression levels and ATAC-seq promoter coverage. We found that the genes with the strongest correlation (high expression and high coverage) are likely involved in housekeeping functions, whereas tissue-specific genes were highly expressed and had only medium-low coverage. We also predicted that genes with medium-low expression and high promoter coverage were actively repressed. Within this group, we extracted a protein-protein interaction network enriched for neuronal functions, likely preventing the cells from adopting a neuronal fate. We further confirmed that a repressive histone mark is bound to the promoters of genes in this network. Finally, we ran our pipeline using ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data generated in ten additional cell types. We again found that genes with the strongest correlation are enriched for housekeeping functions and that genes with medium-low promoter coverage and high expression are more likely to be tissue-specific. These results demonstrate that only two data types, both of which require relatively low starting material to generate and are becoming more commonly available, can be integrated to understand multiple aspects of gene regulation. Conclusions: Within the placenta, we identified an active placenta-specific gene network as well as a repressed neuronal network. Beyond the placenta, we demonstrate that ATAC-seq data and RNA-seq data can be integrated to identify tissue-specific genes and actively repressed gene networks in multiple cell types.},

   abstract = {Cell-fate transitions involve the integration of genomic information encoded by regulatory elements, such as enhancers, with the cellular environment. However, identification of genomic sequences that control human embryonic development represents a formidable challenge. Here we show that in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), unique chromatin signatures identify two distinct classes of genomic elements, both of which are marked by the presence of chromatin regulators p300 and BRG1, monomethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1), and low nucleosomal density. In addition, elements of the first class are distinguished by the acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27ac), overlap with previously characterized hESC enhancers, and are located proximally to genes expressed in hESCs and the epiblast. In contrast, elements of the second class, which we term gpoised enhancers-™, are distinguished by the absence of H3K27ac, enrichment of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), and are linked to genes inactive in hESCs and instead are involved in orchestrating early steps in embryogenesis, such as gastrulation, mesoderm formation and neurulation. Consistent with the poised identity, during differentiation of hESCs to neuroepithelium, a neuroectoderm-specific subset of poised enhancers acquires a chromatin signature associated with active enhancers. When assayed in zebrafish embryos, poised enhancers are able to direct cell-type and stage-specific expression characteristic of their proximal developmental gene, even in the absence of sequence conservation in the fish genome. Our data demonstrate that early developmental enhancers are epigenetically pre-marked in hESCs and indicate an unappreciated role of H3K27me3 at distal regulatory elements. Moreover, the wealth of new regulatory sequences identified here provides an invaluable resource for studies and isolation of transient, rare cell populations representing early stages of human embryogenesis. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Different classes of such elements - particularly enhancers, but also locus control regions and insulators - have been defined by specific functional assays, although it is not always clear how these assays relate to the function of these elements within their native loci. Recent advances in genomics suggest, however, that such elements are highly abundant within the genome and may represent the primary mechanism by which cell- and developmental-specific gene expression is accomplished. In this review, we discuss the functional parameters of enhancers as defined by specific assays, along with the frequency with which they occur in the genome.

Although enhancer elements are known to be associated with certain histone modifications and transcription factors, the relationship of these modifications to gene expression and developmental state has not been clearly defined. Here we interrogate the epigenetic landscape of enhancer elements in embryonic stem cells and several adult tissues in the mouse. We find that histone H3K27ac distinguishes active enhancers from inactive/poised enhancer elements containing H3K4me1 alone. This indicates that the amount of actively used enhancers is lower than previously anticipated. Furthermore, poised enhancer networks provide clues to unrealized developmental programs.

   abstract = {Chromatin states are highly cell-type-specific, but the underlying mechanisms for the establishment and maintenance of their ge-nome-wide patterns remain poorly understood. Here we present a computational approach for investigation of chromatin-state plasticity. We applied this approach to investigate an ENCODE ChIP-seq dataset profiling the genome-wide distributions of the H3K27me3 mark in 19 human cell lines. We found that the high plasticity regions (HPRs) can be divided into two functionally and mechanistically distinct subsets, which correspond to CpG island (CGI) proximal or distal regions, respectively. Although the CGI proximal HPRs are typically associated with continuous variation across different cell-types, the distal HPRs are associated with binary-like variations. We developed a computational approach to predict putative cell-type-specific modulators of H3K27me3 patterns and validated the predictions by comparing with public ChIP-seq data. Furthermore, we applied this approach to investigate mechanisms for poised enhancer establishment in primary human erythroid precursors. Importantly, we predicted and experimentally validated that the principal hematopoietic regulator T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia-1 (TAL1) is involved in regulating H3K27me3 variations in collaboration with the transcription factor growth factor independent 1B (GFI1B), providing fresh insights into the context-specific role of TAL1 in erythropoiesis. Our approach is generally applicable to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of epigenetic pathways in establishing cellular identity. polycomb | hematopoiesis | histone modifications | motifs I n eukaryotic cells the genome is organized into chromatin. The structure of the chromatin is highly cell-type-specific, providing an important additional layer of gene regulation. Recent genome-wide studies have identified the configuration of chro-matin states with high resolution in diverse cell-types, and shown that genome-wide transcriptional levels are highly correlated with chromatin-state switches (1-5). Even within the same cell-type, chromatin-state switches are closely involved in fine-tuning gene-expression patterns in a developmental stage-specific manner (6, 7). These studies have provided strong evidence that the chromatin state plays an important role in establishing cell identity during development. Despite the extensive epigenomic data generated during the past decade, mechanistic understanding of the determinants for chromatin states remains lacking. Whereas numerous regulatory pathways have been suggested (8), few studies have evaluated the contribution of each pathway to genome-wide patterns. Computational methods have been developed, but it remains difficult to predict genome-wide chromatin states ab initio (9). One of the most intensely studied chromatin marks is H3K27me3, which is highly associated with gene repression and catalyzed by the EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2) subunit of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Previous studies of H3K27me3 patterns have mainly been focused on promoter regions, where H3K27me3 target promoters are highly enriched with GC content (10, 11). Additional specificity is associated with a number of transcription factor (TF) motifs (12-14). Although less studied, a significant fraction of H3K27me3 is located in distal regions. It has been proposed that distal H3K27me3 marks poised enhancers, which can be activated through replacing H3K27me3 by H3K27ac (15, 16). An important question is whether there is a general principle controlling the plastic changes of H3K27me3 patterns across different cell types. To systematically investigate the mechanisms modulating chromatin-state plasticity, we developed and validated a computational approach to identify distinct lineage-restricted regulators by focusing on high plasticity regions (HPRs). These regions were selected based on analyzing ChIP-seq data in numerous cell lines. We applied this approach to analysis of H3K27me3 ChIP-seq datasets obtained from the ENCODE consortium (17). We showed that the locations of the HPRs can be predicted by the underlying DNA sequences. These HPRs can be divided into two groups, corresponding to CpG island (CGI)-proximal and CGI-distal regions, with distinct properties. We found that the CGI-distal regions are more cell-type-specific and associated with distinct lineage-restricted transcriptional regulators. We applied this approach to investigate the regulation of the H3K27me3 pattern in primary human erythroid progenitor (ProE) cells, and identified a previously unrecognized context-specific function of the master regulator T-cell acute leukemia-1 (TAL1) in gene silencing through modulating poised enhancer activities. Significance We developed a computational approach to characterize chromatin-state plasticity across cell types, using the repressive mark H3K27me3 as an example. The high plasticity regions (HPRs) can be divided into two functionally and mechanistically distinct groups, corresponding to CpG island proximal and distal regions, respectively. We identified cell-type-specific regulators correlating with H3K27me3 patterns at distal HPRs in ENCODE cell lines as well as in primary human erythroid precursors. We predicted and validated a previously unrecognized role of T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia-1 (TAL1) in modulating H3K27me3 patterns through interaction with additional cofactors, such as growth factor independent 1B (GFI1B). Our integrative approach provides mechanistic insights into chromatin-state plasticity and is broadly applicable to other epigenetic marks.},

They are able to spontaneously differentiate into derivatives of the three embryonic germ layers in vitro and generate teratomas in immunodeficient mice. When injected into an early blastocyst, SSCs contribute to the development of various organs and show germline transmission. Thus, the capacity to form multipotent cells persists in adult mouse testis.

First, DNA hypomethylation at embryonic developmental genes supports their epigenetic “poising” in hSSCs for future/embryonic expression, while core pluripotency genes (OCT4 and NANOG) were transcriptionally and epigenetically repressed. Interestingly, open chromatin in hSSCs was strikingly enriched in binding sites for pioneer factors (NFYA/B, DMRT1, and hormone receptors). Remarkably, single-cell RNA-seq clustering analysis identified four cellular/developmental states during hSSC differentiation, involving major transitions in cell-cycle and transcriptional regulators, splicing and signaling factors, and glucose/mitochondria regulators. Overall, our results outline the dynamic chromatin/transcription landscape operating in hSSCs and identify crucial molecular pathways that accompany the transition from quiescence to proliferation and differentiation. Cairns and colleagues show that human spermatogonial stem cells (hSSCs) bear unique DNA methylation and open chromatin landscapes, which may enable proper development, niche responsiveness, and “poised” pluripotency.

We comprehensively mapped binding sites for 26 pairs of orthologous TFs in two pairs of human and mouse cell lines (representing two cell lineages), along with epigenomic profiles, including DNA methylation and six histone modifications. Overall, we found that 20% of binding sites were embedded within TEs. This number varied across different TFs, ranging from 2% to 40%. We further identified 710 TF-TE relationships in which genomic copies of a TE subfamily contributed a significant number of binding peaks for a TF, and we found that LTR elements dominated these relationships in human. Importantly, TE-derived binding peaks were strongly associated with open and active chromatin signatures, including reduced DNA methylation and increased enhancer-associated histone marks. On average, 66% of TE-derived binding events were cell type-specific with a cell type-specific epigenetic landscape. Most of the binding sites contributed by TEs were species-specific, but we also identified binding sites conserved between human and mouse, the functional relevance of which was supported by a signature of purifying selection on DNA sequences of these TEs. Interestingly, several TFs had significantly expanded binding site landscapes only in one species, which were linked to species-specific gene functions, suggesting that TEs are an important driving force for regulatory innovation. Taken together, our data suggest that TEs have significantly and continuously shaped gene regulatory networks during mammalian evolution.},

Here, we extend a recently developed technique, based on deep paired-end sequencing of lightly digested chromatin, to assess footprints of nucleosomes and other DNA-binding proteins genome-wide in murine ESCs and sperm. In ESCs, we recover well-characterized features of chromatin such as promoter nucleosome depletion and further identify widespread footprints of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins such as CTCF, which we validate in knockdown studies. We document global differences in nuclease accessibility between ESCs and sperm, finding that the majority of histone retention in sperm preferentially occurs in large gene-poor genomic regions, with only a small subset of nucleosomes being retained over promoters of developmental regulators. Finally, we describe evidence that CTCF remains associated with the genome in mature sperm, where it could play a role in organizing the sperm genome. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {During spermatogenesis, germ cells undergo massive cellular reconstruction and dynamic chromatin remodeling to facilitate highly diverse transcriptomes, which are required for the production of functional sperm. However, it remains unknown how germline chromatin is organized to promote the dynamic, complex transcriptomes of spermatogenesis. Here, using ATAC-seq, we establish the varied landscape of open chromatin during spermatogenesis. We identify the reorganization of accessible chromatin in intergenic and intronic regions during the mitosis-to-meiosis transition. During the transition, mitotic-type open chromatin is closed while the de novoformation of meiotic-type open chromatin takes place. Contrastingly, differentiation processes such as spermatogonial differentiation and the meiosis-to-postmeiosis transition involve chromatin closure without the de novo formation of accessible chromatin. In spermiogenesis, the germline-specific Polycomb protein SCML2 promotes the closure of open chromatin at autosomes for gene suppression. Paradoxically, we identify the massive de novoformation of accessible chromatin when the sex chromosomes undergo meiotic sex chromosome inactivation, and this is also mediated by SCML2. These results reveal meiotic sex chromosome inactivation as an active process for chromatin organization. Together, our results unravel the genome-wide, dynamic reorganization of open chromatin and reveal mechanisms that underlie diverse transcriptomes during spermatogenesis.},

However, due to the small number of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) and deficiency of efficient markers, it is difficult to obtain very pure SSCs, which results in the research on them being hindered. In fact, many methods have been developed to isolate and purify SSCs, but these methods have their shortcomings. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), as a method to enrich SSCs with the help of specific surface markers, has the characteristics of high efficiency and accuracy in enrichment of SSCs, thus it is widely accepted as an effective method for purification of SSCs. This review summarizes the recent studies on the application of FACS in SSCs, and introduces some commonly used markers of effective SSCs sorting, aiming to further optimize the FACS sorting method for SSCs, so as to promote the research of germline stem cells and provide new ideas for the research of reproductive biology.},

   abstract = {The naive embryonic stem cells (nESCs) display unique characteristics compared with the primed counterparts, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here we investigate the functional roles of Lncenc1, a highly abundant long noncoding RNA in nESCs. Knockdown or knockout of Lncenc1 in mouse nESCs leads to a significantly decreased expression of core pluripotency genes and a significant reduction of colony formation capability. Furthermore, upon the depletion of Lncenc1, the expression of glycolysis-associated genes is significantly reduced, and the glycolytic activity is substantially impaired, as indicated by a more than 50% reduction in levels of glucose consumption, lactate production, and extracellular acidification rate. Mechanistically, Lncenc1 interacts with PTBP1 and HNRNPK, which regulate the transcription of glycolytic genes, thereby maintaining the self-renewal of nESCs. Our results demonstrate the functions of Lncenc1 in linking energy metabolism and naive state of ESCs, which may enhance our understanding of the molecular basis underlying naive pluripotency. In this article, Bo Wen and colleagues show that Lncenc1, a long noncoding highly RNA abundant in naive ESCs (nESC), maintains self-renewal of nESCs by controlling glycolytic activity. Lncenc1 interacts with HNRNPK and PTBP1, which function as a complex activator of glycolysis gene expression. These results suggested roles of lncRNAs in linking energy metabolism and naive pluripotency.},

Interaction of FGF ligands with their signaling receptors is regulated by protein or proteoglycan cofactors and by extracellular binding proteins. Activated FGFRs phosphorylate specific tyrosine residues that mediate interaction with cytosolic adaptor proteins and the RAS-MAPK, PI3K-AKT, PLCγ, and STAT intracellular signaling pathways. Four structurally related intracellular non-signaling FGFs interact with and regulate the family of voltage gated sodium channels. Members of the FGF family function in the earliest stages of embryonic development and during organogenesis to maintain progenitor cells and mediate their growth, differentiation, survival, and patterning. FGFs also have roles in adult tissues where they mediate metabolic functions, tissue repair, and regeneration, often by reactivating developmental signaling pathways. Consistent with the presence of FGFs in almost all tissues and organs, aberrant activity of the pathway is associated with developmental defects that disrupt organogenesis, impair the response to injury, and result in metabolic disorders, and cancer.},

However, critical properties of PTFs are still poorly understood, such as how these transcription factors selectively recognize cell type-specific binding sites and under which conditions they can initiate chromatin remodelling. Here we show that early endoderm binding sites of the paradigm PTF Foxa2 are epigenetically primed by low levels of active chromatin modifications in embryonic stem cells (ESC). Priming of these binding sites is supported by preferential recruitment of Foxa2 to endoderm binding sites compared to lineage-inappropriate binding sites, when ectopically expressed in ESCs. We further show that binding of Foxa2 is required for chromatin opening during endoderm differentiation. However, increased chromatin accessibility was only detected on binding sites which are synergistically bound with other endoderm transcription factors. Thus, our data suggest that binding site selection of PTFs is directed by the chromatin environment and that chromatin opening requires collaboration of PTFs with additional transcription factors.</p>},

The human TDRP gene had two distinct transcripts, TDRP1 and TDRP2, which encoded proteins of 183 aa and 198 aa respectively. Tdrp mRNA was predominantly expressed in testis tissue. We generated rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific against human TDRP1. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed TDRP1 was expressed in spermatogenic cells, especially with high expression in spermatocytes. We provided evidence that TDRP1 distributed in both cytoplasm and nuclei of spermatogenic cells. Expression patterns of Tdrp1 mRNA and its protein were investigated in the rat testis tissues of different developmental stages. Both Tdrp1 mRNA and its protein were barely detected in the testis of neonatal rats, increased remarkably at 3 weeks postpartum, and peaked at 2 months postpartum. We also investigated TDRP1 expressions in testis tissues of azoospermic men with defective spermatogenesis. Western blot analysis showed that TDRP1 expressions were significantly lower in the testis tissues of azoospermic men compared with normal controls. These current data demonstrated that as a nuclear factor, TDRP1 might play an important role in spermatogenesis. Crown Copyright © 2010.},

   abstract = {Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1) is a highly conserved RNA-binding protein that is a well-known regulator of alternative splicing. Testicular tissue is one of the richest tissues with respect to the number of alternative splicing mRNA isoforms, but the molecular role(s) of PTBP1 in the regulation of these isoforms during spermatogenesis is still unclear. Here, we developed a germ cell-specific Ptbp1 conditional knockout (cKO) mouse model by using the Cre-loxP system to investigate the role of PTBP1 in spermatogenesis. Testis weight in Ptbp1 cKO mice was comparable to that in age-matched controls until 3 weeks of age; at ≥ 2 months old, testis weight was significantly lighter in cKO mice than in age-matched controls. Sperm count in Ptbp1 cKO mice at 2 months old was comparable to that in controls, whereas sperm count significantly decreased at 6 months old. Seminiferous tubules that exhibited degeneration in spermatogenic function were more evident in the 2-month-old Ptbp1 cKO mice than in controls. In addition, the early neonatal proliferation of spermatogonia, during postnatal days 1-5, was significantly retarded in Ptbp1 cKO mice compared with that in controls. An in vitro spermatogonia culture model (germline stem cells) revealed that hydroxytamoxifen-induced deletion of PTBP1 from germline stem cells caused severe proliferation arrest accompanied by an increase of apoptotic cell death. These data suggest that PTBP1 contributes to spermatogenesis through regulation of spermatogonia proliferation.},

   abstract = {Transcription regulation in male germ cells can involve specialised mechanisms and testis-specific paralogues of the general transcription machinery. Here we describe TAF7L, a germ-cell-specific paralogue of the TFIID subunit TAF7. TAF7L is expressed through most of the male germ-cell differentiation programme, but its intracellular localisation is dynamically regulated from cytoplasmic in spermatogonia and early spermatocytes to nuclear in late pachytene spermatocytes and haploid round spermatids. Import of TAF7L into the nucleus coincides with decreased TAF7 expression and a strong increase in nuclear TBP expression, which suggests that TAF7L replaces TAF7 as a TFIID subunit in late pachytene spermatocytes and in haploid cells. In agreement with this, biochemical experiments indicate that a subpopulation of TAF7L is tightly associated with TBP in both pachytene and haploid cells and TAF7L interacts with the TFIID subunit TAF1. We further show that TAF3, TAF4 and TAF10 are all strongly expressed in early spermatocytes, but that in contrast to TBP and TAF7L, they are downregulated in haploid cells. Hence, different subunits of the TFIID complex are regulated in distinct ways during male germ-cell differentiation. These results show for the first time how the composition of a general transcription factor such as TFIID and other TAF-containing complexes are modulated during a differentiation programme highlighting the unique nature of the transcription regulatory machinery in spermatogenesis.},

Although studies have revealed the role of the GDNF signaling pathway in SSCs, little is known about how FGF2 is involved. In the present study, we assessed the role of the FGF2 signaling pathway using a mouse germline stem (GS) cell culture system that allows in vitro expansion of SSCs. Adding GDNF or FGF2 induced phosphorylation of MAPK1/3, and adding the MAP2K1 inhibitor PD0325091 reduced GS cell proliferation and MAPK1/3 phosphorylation. Moreover, GS cells transfected with an activated form of Map2k1 not only upregulated Etv5 and Bcl6b gene expression, but also proliferated in an FGF2-independent manner, suggesting that they act downstream of MAP2K1 signaling to drive SSC self-renewal. Although GS cells transfected with Map2k1, Etv5 or Bcl6b showed normal spermatogonial markers, transplanting GS cells expressing Bcl6b into infertile mouse testes resulted in the formation of a germ cell tumor, suggesting that excessive self-renewal signals causes tumorigenic conversion. These results show that FGF2 depends on MAP2K1 signaling to drive SSC self-renewal via upregulation of the Etv5 and Bcl6b genes. © 2012. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.},

Like many eukaryotic transcription factors, these proteins bind to DNA as dimers. Dimerization is mediated by a structure known as the "leucine-zipper" motif. Although Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB were previously thought to interact preferentially with different DNA regulatory elements (the AP-1/TRE and ATF/CRE sites, respectively), we find that members of these two families form selective cross-family heterodimers. The resulting heterodimers display distinguishable DNA binding specificities from each other and from their parental homodimers. These findings indicate that the Fos/Jun and ATF/CREB families of transcription factors are not as distinct as was previously thought. We suggest that they can be grouped into a superfamily of transcription factors.},

Within a given cross section of a seminiferous tubule, multiple germ and somatic cell types co-occur. This cellular heterogeneity has made it difficult to profile distinct cell types at different stages of development. To address this challenge, we collected single-cell RNA sequencing data from ∼35,000 cells from the adult mouse testis and identified all known germ and somatic cells, as well as two unexpected somatic cell types. Our analysis revealed a continuous developmental trajectory of germ cells from spermatogonia to spermatids and identified candidate transcriptional regulators at several transition points during differentiation. Focused analyses delineated four subtypes of spermatogonia and nine subtypes of Sertoli cells; the latter linked to histologically defined developmental stages over the seminiferous epithelial cycle. Overall, this high-resolution cellular atlas represents a community resource and foundation of knowledge to study germ cell development and in vivo gametogenesis. Male germ cell development requires intricate interplay between mitotic, meiotic, and differentiating germ cells and supporting somatic cells. Green et al. apply single-cell RNA sequencing to generate a mouse spermatogenesis resource to untangle cellular heterogeneity within the adult testis, identify regulators of germ cell differentiation, and discover somatic cell types.},

Recently, we developed a knockout mouse model for the H3f3b gene, one of two genes encoding H3.3. Here, we show that targeted disruption of H3f3b results in a number of phenotypic abnormalities, including a reduction in H3.3 histone levels, leading to male infertility, as well as abnormal sperm and testes morphology. Additionally, null germ cell populations at specific stages in spermatogenesis, in particular spermatocytes and spermatogonia, exhibited increased rates of apoptosis. Disruption of H3f3b also altered histone post-translational modifications and gene expression in the testes, with the most prominent changes occurring at genes involved in spermatogenesis. Finally, H3f3b null testes also exhibited abnormal germ cell chromatin reorganization and reduced protamine incorporation. Taken together, our studies indicate a major role for H3.3 in spermatogenesis through regulation of chromatin dynamics. © 2014. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.},

   abstract = {Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), postnatal male germline stem cells, are the foundation of spermatogenesis, during which an enormous number of spermatozoa is produced daily by the testis throughout life of the male. SSCs are unique among stem cells in the adult body because they are the only cells that undergo self-renewal and transmit genes to subsequent generations. In addition, SSCs provide an excellent and powerful model to study stem cell biology because of the availability of a functional assay that unequivocally identifies the stem cell. Development of an in vitro culture system that allows an unlimited supply of SSCs is a crucial technique to manipulate genes of the SSC to generate valuable transgenic animals, to study the self-renewal mechanism, and to develop new therapeutic strategies for infertility. In this chapter, we describe a detailed protocol for the culture of mouse and rat SSCs. A key factor for successful development of the SSC culture system was identification of in vitro growth factor requirements for the stem cell using a defined serum-free medium. Because transplantation assays using immunodeficient mice demonstrated that extrinsic factors for self-renewal of SSCs appear to be conserved among many mammalian species, culture techniques for SSCs of other species, including farm animals and humans, are likely to be developed in the coming 5-10 years.},

However, the functional importance of individual miRs in controlling spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) homeostasis has not been investigated. Using high-throughput sequencing, we profiled the expression of miRs in the Thy1 + testis cell population, which is highly enriched for SSCs, and the Thy1 − cell population, composed primarily of testis somatic cells. In addition, we profiled the global expression of miRs in cultured germ cells, also enriched for SSCs. Our results demonstrate that miR-21, along with miR-34c, -182, -183, and -146a, are preferentially expressed in the Thy1 + SSC-enriched population, compared with Thy1 − somatic cells. Im-portantly, we demonstrate that transient inhibition of miR-21 in SSC-enriched germ cell cultures increased the number of germ cells undergoing apoptosis and significantly reduced the number of do-nor-derived colonies of spermatogenesis formed from transplanted treated cells in recipient mouse testes, indicating that miR-21 is important in maintaining the SSC population.

However, the growth factors essential for self-renewal of SSCs remain unclear. In this study, a serum-free culture system and a transplantation assay for SSCs were used to identify exogenous soluble factors that promote proliferation of SSCs. Mouse pup testis cells were enriched for SSCs by selection with an anti-Thy-1 antibody and cultured on STO (SIM mouse embryo-derived thioguanine and ouabain resistant) feeders in a serum-free defined medium. In the presence of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), SSCs from DBA/2J strain mice formed densely packed clumps of cells and continuously proliferated. However, other strains of mice required the addition of soluble GDNF-family receptor alpha-1 and basic fibroblast growth factor to support replication. The functional transplantation assay proved that the clump-forming cells are indeed SSCs. Thus, GDNF-induced cell signaling plays a central role in SSC self-renewal. The number of SSCs in culture doubled every 5.6 days, and the clump-forming cells strongly expressed Oct-4. Under these conditions, SSCs proliferated over 6 months, reconstituted long-term spermatogenesis after transplantation into recipient testes, and restored fertility to infertile recipients. The identification of exogenous factors that allow continuous proliferation of SSCs in vitro establishes the foundation to study the basic biology of SSCs and makes possible germ-line modification by sophisticated technologies. Moreover, the ability to recover, culture indefinitely, and transplant SSCs will make the germ-line of individual males available for periods extending beyond a normal lifetime.},

Although the development of the spermatogonial transplantation technique has provided an assay system for stem cells, efficient methods to enrich stem cells have not been available. Here, we examined two infertile mouse models, Steel/SteelDickie(Sl/Sld) and experimental cryptorchid, as a source of testis cell populations enriched in stem cells. The Sl/Sld testis showed little enrichment, which raises questions about how adult stem cell number is determined and about the currently accepted belief that adult stem cells are independent of Sl factor. The cells recovered from cryptorchid testes were enriched for stem cells 25-fold (colonies) or 50-fold (area) compared to wild-type testes. The cryptorchid condition does not affect stem cell activity, but eliminates almost all differentiated cells, and about 1 in 200 cells is a stem cell. Thus, cryptorchid testes provide an important approach for purification and characterization of spermatogonial stem cells.},

These subsets are also distinguishable by transcriptome signatures. Moreover, using a conditional overexpression mouse model, we found that transition from the stem cell to the immediate progenitor state requires downregulation of Id4 coincident with a major change in the transcriptome.

Subsequently, testis side population (SP) cells, which are defined by a Hoechst dye efflux assay, were identified. Their surface phenotype was found to be MHC-I+Thy-1-Sca-1+, and the transplantation assay demonstrated that the testis SP and SSCs are distinct populations. In several other tissues, the SP has been shown to contain stem cells, but we found that this characteristic does not define SSCs.

   abstract = {Stem cells reside in specialized microenvironments created by supporting stromal cells that orchestrate self-renewal and lineage-specific differentiation. However, the precise identity of the cellular and molecular pathways that support self-renewal of stem cells is not known. For example, long-term culture of prototypical stem cells, such as adult spermatogonial stem and progenitor cells (SPCs), in vitro has been impeded by the lack of an optimal stromal cell line that initiates and sustains proliferation of these cells. Indeed, current methods, including the use of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), have not been efficient and have generally led to inconsistent results. Here, we report the establishment of a novel CD34-positive cell line, referred to as JK1, derived from mouse testicular stromal cells that not only facilitated long-term SPC culture but also allowed faithful generation of SPCs and multipotent stem cells. SPCs generated on JK1 maintained key features of germ line stem cells, including expression of PLZF, DAZL, and GCNA. Furthermore, these feeders also promoted the long-term cultivation of other types of primitive cells including multipotent adult spermatogonial-derived stem cells, pluripotent murine embryonic stem cells, and embryonic germ cells derived from primordial germ cells. Stem cells could be passaged serially and still maintained expression of characteristic markers such as OCT4 and NANOG in vitro, as well as the ability to generate all three germ layers in vivo. These results indicate that the JK1 cell line is capable of promoting long-term culture of primitive cells. As such, this cell line allows for identification of stromal-derived factors that support long-term proliferation of various types of stem cells and constitutes a convenient alternative to other types of feeder layers. Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest is found at the end of this article.},

   abstract = {Male infertility is most commonly caused by spermatogenic defects or insufficiencies, the majority of which are as yet cureless. Recently, we succeeded in cultivating mouse testicular tissues for producing fertile sperm from spermatogonial stem cells. Here, we show that one of the most severe types of spermatogenic defect mutant can be treated by the culture method without any genetic manipulations. The Sl/Sl(d) mouse is used as a model of such male infertility. The testis of the Sl/Sl(d) mouse has only primitive spermatogonia as germ cells, lacking any sign of spermatogenesis owing to mutations of the c-kit ligand (KITL) gene that cause the loss of membrane-bound-type KITL from the surface of Sertoli cells. To compensate for the deficit, we cultured testis tissues of Sl/Sl(d) mice with a medium containing recombinant KITL and found that it induced the differentiation of spermatogonia up to the end of meiosis. We further discovered that colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) enhances the effect of KITL and promotes spermatogenesis up to the production of sperm. Microinsemination of haploid cells resulted in delivery of healthy offspring. This study demonstrated that spermatogenic impairments can be treated in vitro with the supplementation of certain factors or substances that are insufficient in the original testes.},

However, no unique phenotypic markers to identify SSCs have been described. In this study, the SSC surface phenotype was characterized by using flow cytometric cell sorting in conjunction with a transplantation functional assay for SSCs. Highly enriched stem cell activity was found in the MHC class I (MHC-I)-Thy-1+c-kit- cell fraction of the mouse cryptorchid testis. There was little or no stem cell activity in any other fraction. The antigenic phenotype of the MHC-I-Thy-1+c-kit- SSCs was alpha6-integrin+CD24+alphavintegrin-Sca-1-CD34-. Subsequently, testis side population (SP) cells, which are defined by a Hoechst dye efflux assay, were identified. Their surface phenotype was found to be MHC-I+Thy-1-Sca-1+, and the transplantation assay demonstrated that the testis SP and SSCs are distinct populations. In several other tissues, the SP has been shown to contain stem cells, but we found that this characteristic does not define SSCs. The identification of a surface phenotype that allows production of a highly enriched SSC population will facilitate functional and genomic studies and enable further comparison with other stem cells.},

   abstract = {Continual spermatogenesis at a quantitatively normal level is required to sustain male fertility. The foundation of this process relies on maintenance of an undifferentiated spermatogonial population consisting of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) that self-renew as well as transient amplifying progenitors produced by differentiation. In mammals, type A(single) spermatogonia form the SSC population, but molecular markers distinguishing these from differentiating progenitors are undefined and knowledge of mechanisms regulating their functions is limited. We show that in the mouse male germline the transcriptional repressor ID4 is expressed by a subpopulation of undifferentiated spermatogonia and selectively marks A(single) spermatogonia. In addition, we found that ID4 expression is up-regulated in isolated SSC-enriched fractions by stimulation from GDNF, a key growth factor driving self-renewal. In mice lacking ID4 expression, quantitatively normal spermatogenesis was found to be impaired due to progressive loss of the undifferentiated spermatogonial population during adulthood. Moreover, reduction of ID4 expression by small interfering RNA treatment abolished the ability of wild-type SSCs to expand in vitro during long-term culture without affecting their survival. Collectively, these results indicate that ID4 is a distinguishing marker of SSCs in the mammalian germline and plays an important role in the regulation of self-renewal.},

   abstract = {Recent studies have shown that the dominant white spotting (W) locus encodes the proto-oncogene c-kit, a member of the tyrosine kinase receptor family. One symptom of mice bearing mutation within this gene is sterility due to developmental failure of the primordial germ cells during early embryogenesis. To elucidate the role of the c-kit in gametogenesis, we used an anti-c-kit monoclonal antibody, ACK2, as an antagonistic blocker for c-kit function to interfere with the development of male and female germ cells during postnatal life. ACK2 enabled us to detect the expression of c-kit in the gonadal tissue and also to determine the functional status of c-kit, which is expressed on the surface of a particular cell lineage. Consistent with our immunohistochemical findings, the intravenous injection of ACK2 into adult mice caused a depletion in the differentiating type A spermatogonia from the testis during 24-36 h, while the undifferentiated type A spermatogonia were basically unaffected. Intraperitoneal injections of ACK2 into prepuberal mice could completely block the mitosis of mature (differentiating) type A spermatogonia, but not the mitosis of the gonocytes and primitive type A spermatogonia, or the meiosis of spermatocytes. Our results indicate that the survival and/or proliferation of the differentiating type A spermatogonia requires c-kit, but the primitive (undifferentiated) type A spermatogonia or spermatogenic stem cells are independent from c-kit. Moreover, the antibody administration had no significant effect on oocyte maturation despite its intense expression of c-kit.},

   abstract = {Continual spermatogenesis relies on the activities of a tissue-specific stem cell population referred to as spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). Fate decisions of stem cells are influenced by their niche environments, a major component of which is soluble factors secreted by support cells. At present, the factors that constitute the SSC niche are undefined. We explored the role of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12) signaling via its receptor C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) in regulation of mouse SSC fate decisions. Immunofluorescent staining for CXCL12 protein in cross sections of testes from both pup and adult mice revealed its localization at the basement membrane of seminiferous tubules. Within the undifferentiated spermatogonial population of mouse testes, a fraction of cells were found to express CXCR4 and possess stem cell capacity. Inhibition of CXCR4 signaling in primary cultures of mouse undifferentiated spermatogonia resulted in SSC loss, in part by reducing proliferation and increasing the transition to a progenitor state primed for differentiation upon stimulation by retinoic acid. In addition, CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling in mouse SSCs was found to be important for colonization of recipient testes following transplantation, possibly by influencing homing to establish stem-cell niches. Furthermore, inhibition of CXCR4 signaling in testes of adult mice impaired SSC maintenance, leading to loss of the germline. Collectively, these findings indicate that CXCL12 is an important component of the growth factor milieu of stem cells in mammalian testes and that it signals via the CXCR4 to regulate maintenance of the SSC pool.},

Although the levels of DNA methyltransferases change dynamically in the neonatal and early postnatal male germ cells, detailed genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of these cells during the stem cell formation and differentiation have not been reported. To understand the regulation of spermatogonial stem cell formation and differentiation, we examined the DNA methylation and gene expression dynamics of male mouse germ cells at the critical stages: neonatal prospermatogonia, and early postntal (day 7) undifferentiated and differentiating spermatogonia. We found large partially methylated domains similar to those found in cancer cells and placenta in all these germ cells, and high levels of non-CG methylation and 5-hydroxymethylcytosines in neonatal prospermatogonia. Although the global CG methylation levels were stable in early postnatal male germ cells, and despite the reported scarcity of differential methylation in the adult spermatogonial stem cells, we identified many regions showing stage-specific differential methylation in and around genes important for stem cell function and spermatogenesis. These regions contained binding sites for specific transcription factors including the SOX family members. Our findings show a distinctive and dynamic regulation of DNA methylation during spermatogonial stem cell formation and differentiation in the neonatal and early postnatal testes. Furthermore, we revealed a unique accumulation and distribution of non-CG methylation and 5hmC marks in neonatal prospermatogonia. These findings contrast with the reported scarcity of differential methylation in adult spermatogonial stem cell differentiation and represent a unique phase of male germ cell development.},

This has been highlighted in the context of several medical conditions such as cancer, liver disease, cardiovascular disease, and central nervous system disorders, among many others. Here we assessed several steps involved in the development of an ncRNA biomarker discovery pipeline, ranging from sample preparation to bioinformatic processing of small RNA sequencing data. A total of 45 biological samples were included in the present study. All libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Small RNA protocol and sequenced using the HiSeq2500 or MiSeq Illumina sequencers. Small RNA sequencing data was validated using qRT-PCR. At each stage, we evaluated the pros and cons of different techniques that may be suitable for different experimental designs. Evaluation methods included quality of data output in relation to hands-on laboratory time, cost, and efficiency of processing. Our results show that good quality sequencing libraries can be prepared from small amounts of total RNA and that varying degradation levels in the samples do not have a significant effect on the overall quantification of sncRNAs via NGS. In addition, we describe the strengths and limitations of three commercially available library preparation methods: (1) Novex TBE PAGE gel; (2) Pippin Prep automated gel system; and (3) AMPure XP beads. We describe our bioinformatics pipeline, provide recommendations for sequencing coverage, and describe in detail the expression and distribution of all sncRNAs in four human tissues: whole-blood, brain, heart and liver. Ultimately this study provides tools and outcome metrics that will aid researchers and clinicians in choosing an appropriate and effective high-throughput sequencing quantification method for various study designs, and overall generating valuable information that can contribute to our understanding of small ncRNAs as potential biomarkers and mediators of biological functions and disease.},

Dividing progenitor cells have intercellular bridges and form syncytia with 2, 4, 8, or 16 cells. Fragmentation of these syncytia may allow some progenitor cells to occupy "niches" and function as stem cells, but this notion requires further investigation.

Sperm from elderly men are functional and able to fertilize eggs and produce offspring, even though daily sperm production is more than 50% lower and damage to sperm DNA is significantly higher in older men than in those who are younger. Our hypothesis is that the SSC/spermatogonial progenitors themselves age. To test this hypothesis, we studied the gene expression profile of mouse SSC/progenitor cells at several ages using microarrays. After sequential enzyme dispersion, we purified the SSC/progenitors with immunomagnetic cell sorting using an antibody to GFRA1, a known SSC/progenitor cell marker. RNA was isolated and used for the in vitro synthesis of amplified and labeled cRNAs that were hybridized to the Affymetrix mouse genome microarrays. The experiments were repeated twice with different cell preparations, and statistically significant results are presented. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was used to confirm the microarray results. Comparison of four age groups (6 days, 21 days, 60 days, and 8 months old) showed a number of genes that were expressed specifically in the older mice. Two of them (i.e. Icam1 and Selp) have also been shown to mark aging hematopoietic stem cells. On the other hand, the expression levels of the genes encoding the SSC markers Gfra1 and Plzf did not seem to be significantly altered by age, indicating that age affects only certain SSC/progenitor properties.},

However, the mechanisms underlying the process remain elusive. To address the problem, we developed a model SSC culture system, first, by establishing techniques to obtain enriched populations of stem cells, and second, by establishing a serum-free culture medium. Flow cytometric cell sorting and the SSC transplantation assay demonstrated that Thy-1 is a unique surface marker of SSCs in neonatal, pup, and adult testes of the mouse. Although the surface phenotype of SSCs is major histocompatibility complex class I(-) Thy-1(+) alpha 6-integrin(+) alpha v-integrin(-/dim) throughout postnatal life, the most enriched population of SSCs was obtained from cryptorchid adult testes by cell-sorting techniques based on Thy-1 expression. This enriched population of SSCs was used to develop a culture system that consisted of serum-free defined medium and STO (SIM mouse embryo-derived thioguanine and ouabain resistant) feeders, which routinely maintained stem cell activity for 1 wk. Combining the culture system and the transplantation assay provided a mechanism to study the effect of single growth factors. A negative effect was demonstrated for several concentrations of basic fibroblast growth factor and leukemia inhibitory factor, whereas glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor and stem cell factor appeared to have a positive effect on stem cell maintenance. The stem cell enrichment strategies and the culture methods described provide a reproducible and powerful assay system to establish the effect of various environmental factors on SSC survival and replication in vitro.},

Previous attempts to introduce adenovirus vectors into spermatogenic cells, including spermatogonial stem cells, have failed to yield evidence of infection, suggesting that male germ cells may be resistant to adenovirus infection. In this study we show the feasibility of transducing spermatogonial stem cells by adenovirus vectors. When testis cells from ROSA26 Cre reporter mice were incubated in vitro with a Cre-expressing adenovirus vector, Cre-mediated recombination occurred at an efficiency of 49-76%, and the infected spermatogonial stem cells could reinitiate spermatogenesis after transplantation into seminiferous tubules of infertile recipient testes. No evidence of germ-line integration of adenovirus vector could be found in offspring from infected stem cells that underwent Cre-mediated recombination, which suggests that the adenovirus vector infected the cells but did not stably integrate into the germ line. Nevertheless, these results suggest that adenovirus may inadvertently integrate into the patient's germ line and indicate that there is no barrier to adenovirus infection in spermatogonial stem cells.},

We found that Id4-Gfp(+) cells exist primarily as a subset of the type A(single) pool, and their frequency is greatest in neonatal development and then decreases in proportion during establishment of the spermatogenic lineage, eventually comprising ∼ 2% of the undifferentiated spermatogonial population in adulthood. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that expression of 11 and 25 genes is unique for the Id4-Gfp(+)/stem cell and Id4-Gfp(-)/progenitor fractions, respectively. Collectively, these findings provide the first definitive evidence that stem cells exist as a rare subset of the A(single) pool and reveal transcriptome features distinguishing stem cell and progenitor states within the mammalian male germline.},

   abstract = {Achieving mammalian spermatogenesis in vitro has a long history of research but remains elusive. The organ culture method has advantages over the cell culture method, because germ cells are in situ albeit the tissue as a whole is in vitro. The method was used in the 1960s and 1970s but encountered difficulties in inducing complete meiosis, i.e., in getting meiosis to proceed beyond the pachytene stage. In the present study, we reevaluated the organ culture method using two lines of transgenic mice, Acr-GFP and Gsg2 (haspin)-GFP mice, whose germ cells express green fluorescent protein (GFP) at the mid and end stages of meiosis onward, respectively. Immature testicular tissues from these mice, ranging from 4.5 to 14.5 days postpartum, were cultured on the surface of the medium, providing a liquid-gas interface. Culturing testicular tissues of all ages tested resulted in the expression of both Acr- and Gsg2-GFP. Round spermatids were identified by a combination of Gsg2-GFP expression, cell size, and the presence of a single nucleus with a dot stained by Hoechst. In addition, the chromosome number of one of such presumptive spermatids was found to be 20 by the premature chromosome condensation method. As our semiquantitative assay system using GFP expression grading was useful for monitoring the effects of different environmental factors, including temperature, oxygen concentration, and antiretinoic molecules, further improvement of the culture conditions should be possible in the future.},

Male germ cells from embryos 12.5-18.5 days postcoitum could expand by glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, a self-renewal factor for SSCs. These cells did not form teratomas, but repopulated seminiferous tubules and produced spermatogenesis, exhibiting spermatogonia potential. However, the offspring from cultured cells showed growth abnormalities and were defective in genomic imprinting. The imprinting defect persisted in both the male and female germlines for at least four generations. Moreover, germ cells in the offspring showed abnormal histone modifications and DNA methylation patterns. These results indicate that fetal germ cells have a limited ability to become pluripotent cells and lose the ability to undergo epigenetic reprogramming by in vitro culture.},

The current study was designed to determine the impact of an altered sperm epigenome on the subsequent development of an adult somatic cell (Sertoli cell) that influences the onset of a specific disease (male infertility). A gestating female rat (F0 generation) was exposed to the agriculture fungicide vinclozolin during gonadal sex determination and then the subsequent F3 generation progeny used for the isolation of Sertoli cells and assessment of testis disease. As previously observed, enhanced spermatogenic cell apoptosis was observed. The Sertoli cells provide the physical and nutritional support for the spermatogenic cells. Over 400 genes were differentially expressed in the F3 generation control versus vinclozolin lineage Sertoli cells. A number of specific cellular pathways were identified to be transgenerationally altered. One of the key metabolic processes affected was pyruvate/lactate production that is directly linked to spermatogenic cell viability. The Sertoli cell epigenome was also altered with over 100 promoter differential DNA methylation regions (DMR) modified. The genomic features and overlap with the sperm DMR were investigated. Observations demonstrate that the transgenerational sperm epigenetic alterations subsequently alters the development of a specific somatic cell (Sertoli cell) epigenome and transcriptome that correlates with adult onset disease (male infertility). The environmentally induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of testis disease appears to be a component of the molecular etiology of male infertility.},

First posted online on 13 January 2017 as 10.1242/dev.146928 Abstract Spermatogenesis is a classic model of cycling cell lineages that depend on a balance between stem cell self-renewal for continuity and formation of progenitors as the initial step in production of differentiated cells. However, the mechanisms guiding the continuum of spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) to progenitor spermatogonial transition and precise identifiers of subtypes in the process are undefined. Here we used an Id4-eGfp reporter mouse to discover that EGFP intensity is predictive of the subsets with the ID4-EGFP Bright population being mostly, if not purely, SSCs while the ID4-EGFP Dim population is in transition to the progenitor state. These subsets are also distinguishable by transcriptome signatures. Moreover, using a conditional overexpression mouse model, we found that transition from the stem cell to immediate progenitor state requires down-regulation of Id4 coincident with a major change in the transcriptome. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the level of ID4 is predictive of stem cell or progenitor capacity in spermatogonia and dictates the interface of transition between the different functional states.},

   abstract = {In mammalian testis, a typical stem cell system ensures continuous spermatozoa production. Lines of experiments have demonstrated that stem cell activity resides in the most primitive small subset of germ cells, that is, As (Asingle), Apr (Apaired), and Aal (Aaligned) spermatogonia, also collectively called undifferentiated spermatogonia. However, their cellular or molecular nature is largely to be elucidated because a gene that is specifically expressed in these cells has not yet been identified, which makes it difficult to study them. In this study, we demonstrate that a class B basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor neurogenin3 (ngn3) is expressed specifically in As, Apr, and Aal spermatogonia because ngn3 is expressed in c-Kit negative spermatogonia throughout the seminiferous cycle, and transgenic labeling with GFP revealed connection of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 ngn3-positive cells via intercellular bridges. ngn3 is first expressed at the prepubertal stage in c-Kit negative prespermatogonia. Lineage tracing, using the Cre-loxP system, demonstrates that ngn3-positive germ cells give rise to eventually all the spermatogenesis in mature testis. To our knowledge, ngn3 is the first reported gene that delineates these earliest stages of spermatogenesis. Considering its molecular nature, ngn3 could be involved in their differentiation control. Moreover, visualization with GFP and targeting expression of exogenous genes are valuable tools to investigate the mammalian spermatogenic stem cell system.},

   abstract = {Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) self-renew and produce large numbers of committed progenitors that are destined to differentiate into spermatozoa throughout life. However, the growth factors essential for self-renewal of SSCs remain unclear. In this study, a serum-free culture system and a transplantation assay for SSCs were used to identify exogenous soluble factors that promote proliferation of SSCs. Mouse pup testis cells were enriched for SSCs by selection with an anti-Thy-1 antibody and cultured on STO (SIM mouse embryo-derived thioguanine and ouabain resistant) feeders in a serum-free defined medium. In the presence of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), SSCs from DBA/2J strain mice formed densely packed clumps of cells and continuously proliferated. However, other strains of mice required the addition of soluble GDNF-family receptor alpha-1 and basic fibroblast growth factor to support replication. The functional transplantation assay proved that the clump-forming cells are indeed SSCs. Thus, GDNF-induced cell signaling plays a central role in SSC self-renewal. The number of SSCs in culture doubled every 5.6 days, and the clump-forming cells strongly expressed Oct-4. Under these conditions, SSCs proliferated over 6 months, reconstituted long-term spermatogenesis after transplantation into recipient testes, and restored fertility to infertile recipients. The identification of exogenous factors that allow continuous proliferation of SSCs in vitro establishes the foundation to study the basic biology of SSCs and makes possible germ-line modification by sophisticated technologies. Moreover, the ability to recover, culture indefinitely, and transplant SSCs will make the germ-line of individual males available for periods extending beyond a normal lifetime.},

Here we show an alternative method that harnesses the self-organizing ability of testicular somatic cells. The testicular cells of embryonic or neonatal mice or rats and of newborn pigs were dissociated into single cells. Each of them reorganized into a tubular structure following implantation into the subcutis of immunodeficient mice. When mouse germline stem (GS) cells derived from spermatogonial stem cells and expanded in culture were intermingled with testicular cells of rodents, they were integrated in the reconstituted tubules and differentiated beyond meiosis into spermatids. Normal offspring were produced by the microinjection of those spermatids into oocytes. This method could be applicable to various mammalian species and useful for producing functional gametes from GS cells in a xenoectopic environment.},

The whole process, therefore, has never been reproduced in vitro in mammals, nor in any other species with a very few exceptions in some particular types of fish. Here we show that neonatal mouse testes which contain only gonocytes or primitive spermatogonia as germ cells can produce spermatids and sperm in vitro with serum-free culture media. Spermatogenesis was maintained over 2 months in tissue fragments positioned at the gas-liquid interphase. The obtained spermatids and sperm resulted in healthy and reproductively competent offspring through microinsemination. In addition, neonatal testis tissues were cryopreserved and, after thawing, showed complete spermatogenesis in vitro. Our organ culture method could be applicable through further refinements to a variety of mammalian species, which will serve as a platform for future clinical application as well as mechanistic understanding of spermatogenesis.},

Zfp145 expression was restricted to gonocytes and undifferentiated spermatogonia and was absent in tubules of W/Wv mutants that lack these cells. Mice lacking Zfp145 underwent a progressive loss of spermatogonia with age, associated with increases in apoptosis and subsequent loss of tubule structure but without overt differentiation defects or loss of the supporting Sertoli cells. Spermatogonial transplantation experiments revealed a depletion of spermatogonial stem cells in the adult. Microarray analysis of isolated spermatogonia from Zfp145-null mice before testis degeneration showed alterations in the expression profile of genes associated with spermatogenesis. These results identify Plzf as a spermatogonia-specific transcription factor in the testis that is required to regulate self-renewal and maintenance of the stem cell pool.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE
To illustrate the step-by-step protocol followed to assay germ cell transplantation into the seminiferous epithelium of mouse testes. 

DESIGN
Video presentation of an animal model for research in reproductive and regenerative medicine. 

SETTING
Research laboratory. 

ANIMAL(S)
Male nude mice (NU-Foxn1nu). 

INTERVENTION(S)
Mice were chemically sterilized with alkylant compounds (busulfan) followed by gonadal microsurgery to inject donor germ cells. 

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S)
Donor cells should be labeled with reporter genes, such as green fluorescent protein (GFP), lactose operon (LacZ), or alternatively design an effective strategy with specific antibodies to track them within the recipient testes. Sperm detection in the ejaculate can also be used as a read out. However, in this case detection of the donor genotype in the sperm is mandatory to elucidate their origin. 

RESULT(S)
In the present study we describe the complete protocol for germ cell transplant by efferent duct injection, including the preparation of recipient mice, surgery for the germ cell transplant, and analysis of recipient testes. The main strength of this technique is that it constitutes the gold standard for a functional test of the germ cell potential as only spermatogonial stem cells are able to properly colonize the seminal lumen. Both fresh and frozen/thawed testicular cells are suitable for this technique as donor germ cells. Also, enrichment of living spermatogonial stem cells, previous to the transplant, seems to improve the efficiency of colonization. For proper colonization of germ cells, the niche should be available and thus mouse strains that lack endogenous spermatogenesis such as W/Wv mutant mice are usually used. In the case of nonmatched donor cells, seminiferous epithelium of immune-suppressed recipient mice should be germ cell depleted before the transplant. One limitation of this technique is that the procedure can take up to 3 months. Also, in contrast to the full recovery of spermatogenesis in mouse-to-mouse transplants, xenotransplantation of germ cells from phylogenetically distant species, such as humans into mouse recipients, results in colonization of donor cells and spermatogonial expansion, but fail in their spermatogenic progression due to evolutive incompatibilities with the recipient niche. Xenografting of pieces of donor testis tissue under the skin of mouse hosts is an alternative approach that is currently being investigated to try to so…},

The long-term propagation of rodent SSCs is now possible in vitro, and their genetic modification is feasible. However, their differentiation into sperm is possible only under in vivo conditions. Here we show a new in vitro system that can induce full spermatogenesis from SSC lines or any isolated SSCs. The method depends on an organ culture system onto which SSCs are transplanted. The settled SSCs form colonies and differentiate up into sperm. The resultant haploid cells are fertile, and give rise to healthy offspring through micro-insemination. In addition, the system can induce spermatogenesis from SSCs that show spermatogenic failure due to a micro-environmental defect in their original testes. Thus, an in vitro system is established that can be used to correct or manipulate the micro-environmental conditions required for proper spermatogenesis from murine SSC lines.},

In self-renewing systems for which functional transplantation assays are available, it has long been assumed that stem cells are fixed in the niche and that ablative treatments to remove endogenous stem cells are required for successful donor engraftment. Our results demonstrate that enriched populations of donor stem cells can produce long-lasting spermatogenic colonies in testes of immature and mature, nonablated mice, albeit at a lower frequency than in ablated mice. Colonization of nonablated recipient testes by neonate, pup, and cryptorchid adult donor spermatogonial stem cells demonstrates that competition for niche begins soon after birth and that endogenous stem cells influence the degree and pattern of donor cell colonization. Thus, a dynamic relationship between stem cell and niche exists in the testis, as has been suggested for hematopoiesis. Therefore, similar competitive properties of donor stem cells may be characteristic of all self-renewing systems.},

Here, we mapped the kinetics of this process in vivo using a multi-transgenic reporter mouse model, in silico with single-cell RNA sequencing, and functionally with transplantation analyses to define the SSC trajectory from prospermatogonia. Outcomes revealed that a heterogeneous prospermatogonial population undergoes dynamic changes during late fetal and neonatal development. Differential transcriptome profiles predicted divergent developmental trajectories from fetal prospermatogonia to descendant postnatal spermatogonia. Furthermore, transplantation analyses demonstrated that a defined subset of fetal prospermatogonia is fated to function as SSCs. Collectively, these findings suggest that SSC fate is preprogrammed within a subset of fetal prospermatogonia prior to building of the foundational pool during early neonatal development.},

The pluripotency of these embryonic stem cells was demonstrated conclusively by the observation that subclonal cultures, derived from isolated single cells, can differentiate into a wide variety of cell types. Such embryonic stem cells were isolated from inner cell masses of late blastocysts cultured in medium conditioned by an established teratocarcinoma stem cell line. This suggests that such conditioned medium might contain a growth factor that stimulates the proliferation or inhibits the differentiation of normal pluripotent embryonic cells, or both. This method of obtaining embryonic stem cells makes feasible the isolation of pluripotent cells lines from various types of noninbred embryo, including those carrying mutant genes. The availability of such cell lines should made possible new approaches to the study of early mammalian development.},

Functional assays for stem cells are available only for hematopoiesis and spermatogenesis, and the microenvironment, or niche, for hematopoiesis is relatively inaccessible, making it difficult to analyze donor stem cell colonization events in recipients. In contrast, the recently developed spermatogonial stem cell assay system allows quantitation of individual colonization events, facilitating studies of stem cells and their associated microenvironment. By using this assay system, we found a 39-fold increase in male germ-line stem cells during development from birth to adult in the mouse. However, colony size or area of spermatogenesis generated by neonate and adult stem cells, 2–3 months after transplantation into adult tubules, was similar (∼0.5 mm2). In contrast, the microenvironment in the immature pup testis was 9.4 times better than adult testis in allowing colonization events, and the area colonized per donor stem cell, whether from adult or pup, was about 4.0 times larger in recipient pups than adults. These factors facilitated the restoration of fertility by donor stem cells transplanted to infertile pups. Thus, our results demonstrate that stem cells and their niches undergo dramatic changes in the postnatal testis, and the microenvironment of the pup testis provides a more hospitable environment for transplantation of male germ-line stem cells.

Here, to facilitate germline editing in rats, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to catalyze targeted genomic mutations in rat spermatogonial stem cell cultures. CRISPR/Cas9-modified spermatogonia regenerated spermatogenesis and displayed long-term sperm-forming potential following transplantation into rat testes. Targeted germline mutations in Epsti1 and Erbb3 were vertically transmitted from recipients to exclusively generate ?pure,? non-mosaic mutant progeny. Epsti1 mutant rats were produced with or without genetic selection of donor spermatogonia. Monoclonal enrichment of Erbb3 null germlines unmasked recessive spermatogenesis defects in culture that were buffered in recipients, yielding mutant progeny isogenic at targeted alleles. Thus, spermatogonial gene editing with CRISPR/Cas9 provided a platform for generating targeted germline mutations in rats and for studying spermatogenesis.},

Here, we demonstrate successful gene trapping and homologous recombination in spermatogonial stem cells. Cultured spermatogonial stem cells were transfected with gene trap or gene targeting vectors. Mutagenized stem cells were expanded clonally by drug selection. These cells underwent spermatogenesis and produced heterozygous offspring after transplantation into the seminiferous tubules of infertile mouse testes. Heterozygous mutant mice were intercrossed to produce homozygous gene knockouts. Using this strategy, the efficiency of homologous recombination for the occludin gene locus was 1.7% using a nonisogenic DNA construct. These results demonstrate the feasibility of altering genes in tissue-specific stem cells in a manner similar to embryonic stem cells and have important implications for gene therapy and animal transgenesis.},

   abstract = {Mammalian spermatogenesis is maintained by a continuous supply of differentiating cells from self-renewing stem cells. The stem cell activity resides in a small subset of primitive germ cells, the undifferentiated spermatogonia. However, the relationship between the establishment of this population and the initiation of differentiation in the developing testes remains unclear. In this study, we have investigated this issue by using the unique expression of Ngn3, which is expressed specifically in the undifferentiated spermatogonia, but not in the differentiating spermatogonia or their progenitors, the gonocytes. Our lineage analyses demonstrate that the first round of mouse spermatogenesis initiates directly from gonocytes, without passing through the Ngn3-expressing stage (Ngn3- lineage). By contrast, the subsequent rounds of spermatogenesis are derived from Ngn3-positive undifferentiated spermatogonia, which are also immediate descendents of the gonocytes and represent the stem cell function (Ngn3+ lineage). Thus, in mouse spermatogenesis, the state of the undifferentiated spermatogonia is not an inevitable step but is a developmental option that ensures continuous sperm production. In addition, the segregation of gonocytes into undifferentiated spermatogonia (Ngn3+ lineage) or differentiating spermatogonia (Ngn3- lineage) is topographically related to the establishment of the seminiferous epithelial cycle, thus suggesting a role of somatic components in the establishment of stem cells.},

   abstract = {Spermatogonial stem cells (A(s) spermatogonia) are single cells that either renew themselves or produce A(pr) (paired) spermatogonia predestined to differentiate. In turn, the A(pr) divide into chains of A(al) (aligned) spermatogonia that also divide. The ratio between self-renewal and differentiation of the stem cells is regulated by glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor produced by Sertoli cells, while the receptors are expressed in stem cells. A(s), A(pr) and A(al) spermatogonia proliferate during part of the epithelial cycle forming many A(al) spermatogonia. During epithelial stage VIII, almost all A(al) spermatogonia, few A(pr) and very few A(s) spermatogonia differentiate into A1 spermatogonia. A number of molecules are involved in this differentiation step including the stem cell factor-c-kit system, the Dazl RNA binding protein, cyclin D(2) and retinoic acid. There is no fine regulation of the density of spermatogonial stem cells and consequently, in some areas, many A1 and, in other areas, few A1 spermatogonia are formed. An equal density of spermatocytes is then obtained by the apoptosis of A2, A3 or A4 spermatogonia to remove the surplus cells. The Bcl-2 family members Bax and Bcl-x(L) are involved in this density regulation. Several mechanisms are available to cope with major or minor shortages in germ cell production. After severe cell loss, stem cell renewal is preferred above differentiation and the period of proliferation of A(s), A(pr) and A(al) spermatogonia is extended. Minor shortages are dealt with, at least in part, by less apoptosis among A2-A4 spermatogonia.},

   abstract = {Continuity of cycling cell lineages relies on the activities of undifferentiated stem cell-containing subpopulations. Transition to a differentiating state must occur periodically in a fraction of the population to supply mature cells, coincident with maintenance of the undifferentiated state in others to sustain a foundational stem cell pool. At present, molecular mechanisms regulating these activities are poorly defined for most cell lineages. Spermatogenesis is a model process that is supported by an undifferentiated spermatogonial population and transition to a differentiating state involves attained expression of the KIT receptor. We found that impaired function of the X chromosome-clustered microRNAs 221 and 222 (miR-221/222) in mouse undifferentiated spermatogonia induces transition from a KIT(-) to a KIT(+) state and loss of stem cell capacity to regenerate spermatogenesis. Both Kit mRNA and KIT protein abundance are influenced by miR-221/222 function in spermatogonia. Growth factors that promote maintenance of undifferentiated spermatogonia upregulate miR-221/222 expression; whereas exposure to retinoic acid, an inducer of spermatogonial differentiation, downregulates miR-221/222 abundance. Furthermore, undifferentiated spermatogonia overexpressing miR-221/222 are resistant to retinoic acid-induced transition to a KIT(+) state and are incapable of differentiation in vivo. These findings indicate that miR-221/222 plays a crucial role in maintaining the undifferentiated state of mammalian spermatogonia through repression of KIT expression.},

Zfp145 expression was restricted to gonocytes and undifferentiated spermatogonia and was absent in tubules of W/Wv mutants that lack these cells. Mice lacking Zfp145 underwent a progressive loss of spermatogonia with age, associated with increases in apoptosis and subsequent loss of tubule structure but without overt differentiation defects or loss of the supporting Sertoli cells. Spermatogonial transplantation experiments revealed a depletion of spermatogonial stem cells in the adult. Microarray analysis of isolated spermatogonia from Zfp145-null mice before testis degeneration showed alterations in the expression profile of genes associated with spermatogenesis. These results identify Plzf as a spermatogonia-specific transcription factor in the testis that is required to regulate self-renewal and maintenance of the stem cell pool.},

However, the growth factors essential for self-renewal of SSCs remain unclear. In this study, a serum-free culture system and a transplantation assay for SSCs were used to identify exogenous soluble factors that promote proliferation of SSCs. Mouse pup testis cells were enriched for SSCs by selection with an anti-Thy-1 antibody and cultured on STO (SIM mouse embryo-derived thioguanine and ouabain resistant) feeders in a serum-free defined medium. In the presence of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), SSCs from DBA/2J strain mice formed densely packed clumps of cells and continuously proliferated. However, other strains of mice required the addition of soluble GDNF-family receptor alpha-1 and basic fibroblast growth factor to support replication. The functional transplantation assay proved that the clump-forming cells are indeed SSCs. Thus, GDNF-induced cell signaling plays a central role in SSC self-renewal. The number of SSCs in culture doubled every 5.6 days, and the clump-forming cells strongly expressed Oct-4. Under these conditions, SSCs proliferated over 6 months, reconstituted long-term spermatogenesis after transplantation into recipient testes, and restored fertility to infertile recipients. The identification of exogenous factors that allow continuous proliferation of SSCs in vitro establishes the foundation to study the basic biology of SSCs and makes possible germ-line modification by sophisticated technologies. Moreover, the ability to recover, culture indefinitely, and transplant SSCs will make the germ-line of individual males available for periods extending beyond a normal lifetime.},

RNA sequencing analysis revealed that expression of 11 and 25 genes is unique for the Id4-Gfp(+)/stem cell and Id4-Gfp(-)/progenitor fractions, respectively.

We found that the integrity to regenerate spermatogenesis after transplantation declines with advancing time in primary cultures of pup SSCs and that the efficacy of deriving cultures from adult SSCs is limited with conventional conditions. To address these deficiencies, we optimized the culture environment to favor glycolysis as the primary bioenergetics process. In these conditions, regenerative integrity of pup and adult SSCs was significantly improved and the efficiency of establishing primary cultures was 100%.
