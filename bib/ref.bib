abstract = {We describe a large-scale random approach termed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing ({RRBS}) for analyzing and comparing genomic methylation patterns. {BglII} restriction fragments were size-selected to 500-600 bp, equipped with adapters, treated with bisulfite, {PCR} amplified, cloned and sequenced. We constructed {RRBS} libraries from murine {ES} cells and from {ES} cells lacking {DNA} methyltransferases Dnmt3a and 3b and with knocked-down (kd) levels of Dnmt1 (Dnmt[1(kd),3a-/-,3b-/-]). Sequencing of 960 {RRBS} clones from Dnmt[1(kd),3a-/-,3b-/-] cells generated 343 kb of non-redundant bisulfite sequence covering 66212 cytosines in the genome. All but 38 cytosines had been converted to uracil indicating a conversion rate of \textgreater99.9\%. Of the remaining cytosines 35 were found in {CpG} and 3 in {CpT} dinucleotides. Non-{CpG} methylation was \textgreater250-fold reduced compared with wild-type {ES} cells, consistent with a role for Dnmt3a and/or Dnmt3b in {CpA} and {CpT} methylation. Closer inspection revealed neither a consensus sequence around the methylated sites nor evidence for clustering of residual methylation in the genome. Our findings indicate random loss rather than specific maintenance of methylation in Dnmt[1(kd),3a-/-,3b-/-] cells. Near-complete bisulfite conversion and largely unbiased representation of {RRBS} libraries suggest that random shotgun bisulfite sequencing can be scaled to a genome-wide approach.}

abstract = {{DNase} I hypersensitive sites ({DHSs}) are markers of regulatory {DNA} and have underpinned the discovery of all classes of cis-regulatory elements including enhancers, promoters, insulators, silencers and locus control regions. Here we present the first extensive map of human {DHSs} identified through genome-wide profiling in 125 diverse cell and tissue types. We identify ∼2.9 million {DHSs} that encompass virtually all known experimentally validated cis-regulatory sequences and expose a vast trove of novel elements, most with highly cell-selective regulation. Annotating these elements using {ENCODE} data reveals novel relationships between chromatin accessibility, transcription, {DNA} methylation and regulatory factor occupancy patterns. We connect ∼580,000 distal {DHSs} with their target promoters, revealing systematic pairing of different classes of distal {DHSs} and specific promoter types. Patterning of chromatin accessibility at many regulatory regions is organized with dozens to hundreds of co-activated elements, and the transcellular {DNase} I sensitivity pattern at a given region can predict cell-type-specific functional behaviours. The {DHS} landscape shows signatures of recent functional evolutionary constraint. However, the {DHS} compartment in pluripotent and immortalized cells exhibits higher mutation rates than that in highly differentiated cells, exposing an unexpected link between chromatin accessibility, proliferative potential and patterns of human variation.}

abstract = {Epigenetic information can be inherited through the mammalian germline and represents a plausible transgenerational carrier of environmental information. To test whether transgenerational inheritance of environmental information occurs in mammals, we carried out an expression profiling screen for genes in mice that responded to paternal diet. Offspring of males fed a low-protein diet exhibited elevated hepatic expression of many genes involved in lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis and decreased levels of cholesterol esters, relative to the offspring of males fed a control diet. Epigenomic profiling of offspring livers revealed numerous modest (∼20\%) changes in cytosine methylation depending on paternal diet, including reproducible changes in methylation over a likely enhancer for the key lipid regulator Ppara. These results, in conjunction with recent human epidemiological data, indicate that parental diet can affect cholesterol and lipid metabolism in offspring and define a model system to study environmental reprogramming of the heritable epigenome.

Since the first public release of this annotation data set, few new protein-coding loci have been added, yet the number of alternative splicing transcripts annotated has steadily increased. The {GENCODE} 7 release contains 20,687 protein-coding and 9640 long noncoding {RNA} loci and has 33,977 coding transcripts not represented in {UCSC} genes and {RefSeq}. It also has the most comprehensive annotation of long noncoding {RNA} ({lncRNA}) loci publicly available with the predominant transcript form consisting of two exons. We have examined the completeness of the transcript annotation and found that 35\% of transcriptional start sites are supported by {CAGE} clusters and 62\% of protein-coding genes have annotated {polyA} sites. Over one-third of {GENCODE} protein-coding genes are supported by peptide hits derived from mass spectrometry spectra submitted to Peptide Atlas. New models derived from the Illumina Body Map 2.0 {RNA}-seq data identify 3689 new loci not currently in {GENCODE}, of which 3127 consist of two exon models indicating that they are possibly unannotated long noncoding loci. {GENCODE} 7 is publicly available from gencodegenes.org and via the Ensembl and {UCSC} Genome Browsers.}

abstract = {Complex patterns of histone lysine methylation encode distinct functions within chromatin. We previously reported that trimethylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 ({H3K9}) occurs at both silent heterochromatin and at the transcribed regions of active mammalian genes, suggesting that the extent of histone lysine methylation involved in mammalian gene activation is not completely defined. To identify additional sites of histone methylation that respond to mammalian gene activity, we describe here a comparative assessment of all six known positions of histone lysine methylation and relate them to gene transcription. Using several model loci, we observed high trimethylation of {H3K4}, {H3K9}, {H3K36}, and {H3K79} in the transcribed region, consistent with previous findings. We identify {H4K20} monomethylation, a modification previously linked with repression, as a mark of transcription elongation in mammalian cells. In contrast, {H3K27} monomethylation, a modification enriched at pericentromeric heterochromatin, was observed broadly distributed throughout all euchromatic sites analyzed, with selective depletion in the vicinity of the transcription start sites at active genes. Together, these results underscore that similar to other described methyl-lysine modifications, {H4K20} and {H3K27} monomethylation are versatile and dynamic with respect to gene activity, suggesting the existence of novel site-specific methyltransferases and demethylases coupled to the transcription cycle.}

We demonstrate how {GSEA} yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, {GSEA} reveals many biological pathways in common. The {GSEA} method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.}

We subjected F0 mice to odor fear conditioning before conception and found that subsequently conceived F1 and F2 generations had an increased behavioral sensitivity to the F0-conditioned odor, but not to other odors. When an odor (acetophenone) that activates a known odorant receptor (Olfr151) was used to condition F0 mice, the behavioral sensitivity of the F1 and F2 generations to acetophenone was complemented by an enhanced neuroanatomical representation of the Olfr151 pathway. Bisulfite sequencing of sperm {DNA} from conditioned F0 males and F1 naive offspring revealed {CpG} hypomethylation in the Olfr151 gene. In addition, in vitro fertilization, F2 inheritance and cross-fostering revealed that these transgenerational effects are inherited via parental gametes. Our findings provide a framework for addressing how environmental information may be inherited transgenerationally at behavioral, neuroanatomical and epigenetic levels.}

Intriguingly, we find that as little as 2 days of dietary intervention in fathers elicits obesity in offspring. Paternal sugar acts as a physiological suppressor of variegation, desilencing chromatin-state-defined domains in both mature sperm and in offspring embryos. We identify requirements for {H3K9}/K27me3-dependent reprogramming of metabolic genes in two distinct germline and zygotic windows. Critically, we find evidence that a similar system may regulate obesity susceptibility and phenotype variation in mice and humans.

We show that enhancers share properties with {CpG}-poor messenger {RNA} promoters but produce bidirectional, exosome-sensitive, relatively short unspliced {RNAs}, the generation of which is strongly related to enhancer activity. The atlas is used to compare regulatory programs between different cells at unprecedented depth, to identify disease-associated regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms, and to classify cell-type-specific and ubiquitous enhancers. We further explore the utility of enhancer redundancy, which explains gene expression strength rather than expression patterns. The online {FANTOM5} enhancer atlas represents a unique resource for studies on cell-type-specific enhancers and gene regulation.}

abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: A gene set test is a differential expression analysis in which a P-value is assigned to a set of genes as a unit. Gene set tests are valuable for increasing statistical power, organizing and interpreting results and for relating expression patterns across different experiments. Existing methods are based on permutation. Methods that rely on permutation of probes unrealistically assume independence of genes, while those that rely on permutation of sample are suitable only for two-group comparisons with a good number of replicates in each group. {RESULTS}: We present {ROAST}, a statistically rigorous gene set test that allows for gene-wise correlation while being applicable to almost any experimental design. Instead of permutation, {ROAST} uses rotation, a Monte Carlo technology for multivariate regression. Since the number of rotations does not depend on sample size, {ROAST} gives useful results even for experiments with minimal replication. {ROAST} allows for any experimental design that can be expressed as a linear model, and can also incorporate array weights and correlated samples. {ROAST} can be tuned for situations in which only a subset of the genes in the set are actively involved in the molecular pathway. {ROAST} can test for uni- or bi-direction regulation. Probes can also be weighted to allow for prior importance. The power and size of the {ROAST} procedure is demonstrated in a simulation study, and compared to that of a representative permutation method. Finally, {ROAST} is used to test the degree of transcriptional conservation between human and mouse mammary stems. {AVAILABILITY}: {ROAST} is implemented as a function in the Bioconductor package limma available from www.bioconductor.org.}

However, the role of {ATF}-2 in chromatin assembly in higher organisms remains unknown. This study reveals that Drosophila {ATF}-2 ({dATF}-2) is required for heterochromatin assembly, whereas the stress-induced phosphorylation of {dATF}-2, via Mekk1-p38, disrupts heterochromatin. The {dATF}-2 protein colocalized with {HP1}, not only on heterochromatin but also at specific loci in euchromatin. Heat shock or osmotic stress induced phosphorylation of {dATF}-2 and resulted in its release from heterochromatin. This heterochromatic disruption was an epigenetic event that was transmitted to the next generation in a non-Mendelian fashion. When embryos were exposed to heat stress over multiple generations, the defective chromatin state was maintained over multiple successive generations, though it gradually returned to the normal state. The results suggest a mechanism by which the effects of stress are inherited epigenetically via the regulation of a tight chromatin structure. Copyright \copyright 2011 Elsevier Inc.

It has been demonstrated during the past decade that the posttranslational modifications of histone proteins within the chromosome impact chromatin structure, gene transcription, and epigenetic information. Multiple modifications decorate each histone tail within the nucleosome, including some amino acids that can be modified in several different ways. Covalent modifications of histone tails known thus far include acetylation, phosphorylation, sumoylation, ubiquitination, and methylation. A large body of experimental evidence compiled during the past several years has demonstrated the impact of histone acetylation on transcriptional control. Although histone modification by methylation and ubiquitination was discovered long ago, it was only recently that functional roles for these modifications in transcriptional regulation began to surface. Highlighted in this review are the recent biochemical, molecular, cellular, and physiological functions of histone methylation and ubiquitination involved in the regulation of gene expression as determined by a combination of enzymological, structural, and genetic methodologies.}

Chromatin modifications are major carriers of epigenetic information that both reflect and affect the transcriptional states of underlying genes. Several histone modifications are key players that are responsible for classical epigenetic phenomena. However, the mechanisms by which cells pass their histone modifications to daughter cells through mitotic division remain to be unveiled. Here, we review recent progress in the field and conclude that epigenetic modifications are not precisely maintained at a near-mononucleosome level of precision. We also suggest that transcription repression may be maintained by a buffer system that can tolerate a certain degree of fluctuation in repressive histone modification levels. This buffer system protects the repressed genes from potential improper derepression triggered by chromatin modification-level fluctuation resulting from cellular events, such as the cell-cycle-dependent dilution of the chromatin modifications and local responses to environmental cues.}

abstract = {Transcription factors are adaptor molecules that detect regulatory sequences in the {DNA} and target the assembly of protein complexes that control gene expression. Yet much of the {DNA} in the eukaryotic cell is in nucleosomes and thereby occluded by histones, and can be further occluded by higher-order chromatin structures and repressor complexes. Indeed, genome-wide location analyses have revealed that, for all transcription factors tested, the vast majority of potential {DNA}-binding sites are unoccupied, demonstrating the inaccessibility of most of the nuclear {DNA}. This raises the question of how target sites at silent genes become bound de novo by transcription factors, thereby initiating regulatory events in chromatin. Binding cooperativity can be sufficient for many kinds of factors to simultaneously engage a target site in chromatin and activate gene expression. However, in cases in which the binding of a series of factors is sequential in time and thus not initially cooperative, special "pioneer transcription factors" can be the first to engage target sites in chromatin. Such initial binding can passively enhance transcription by reducing the number of additional factors that are needed to bind the {DNA}, culminating in activation. In addition, pioneer factor binding can actively open up the local chromatin and directly make it competent for other factors to bind. Passive and active roles for the pioneer factor {FoxA} occur in embryonic development, steroid hormone induction, and human cancers. Herein we review the field and describe how pioneer factors may enable cellular reprogramming.}

Although the impacts of paternal impaired fasting blood glucose and glucose intolerance on the metabolism of offspring have been well established, the exact molecular and mechanistic basis that mediates these impacts remains largely unclear. Here we show that paternal prediabetes increases the susceptibility to diabetes in offspring through gametic epigenetic alterations. In our findings, paternal prediabetes led to glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in offspring. Relative to controls, offspring of prediabetic fathers exhibited altered gene expression patterns in the pancreatic islets, with down-regulation of several genes involved in glucose metabolism and insulin signaling pathways. Epigenomic profiling of offspring pancreatic islets revealed numerous changes in cytosine methylation depending on paternal prediabetes, including reproducible changes in methylation over several insulin signaling genes. Paternal prediabetes altered overall methylome patterns in sperm, with a large portion of differentially methylated genes overlapping with that of pancreatic islets in offspring. Our study uniquely revealed that prediabetes can be inherited transgenerationally through the mammalian germ line by an epigenetic mechanism.}

Differentially methylated regions are hypomethylated and enriched in nucleosome-retaining regions. A substantial fraction is resistant to early embryo methylation reprogramming, which may have an impact on F2 development.

We show that use of some filter/test statistics pairs presented in the literature may, however, lead to loss of type I error control. We describe other pairs which avoid this problem. In an application to microarray data, we found that gene-by-gene filtering by overall variance followed by a t-test increased the number of discoveries by 50\%. We also show that this particular statistic pair induces a lower bound on fold-change among the set of discoveries.

In this Review, we discuss key concepts in the function of {DNA} methylation in mammals, stemming from more than two decades of research, including many recent studies that have elucidated when and where {DNA} methylation has a regulatory role in the genome. We include insights from early development, embryonic stem cells and adult lineages, particularly haematopoiesis, to highlight the general features of this modification as it participates in both global and localized epigenetic regulation.}

abstract = {Although there have been many molecular studies of morphological mutants generated in the laboratory, it is unclear how these are related to mutants in natural populations, where the constraints of natural selection and breeding structure are quite different. Here we characterize a naturally occurring mutant of Linaria vulgaris, originally described more than 250 years ago by Linnaeus, in which the fundamental symmetry of the flower is changed from bilateral to radial. We show that the mutant carries a defect in Lcyc, a homologue of the cycloidea gene which controls dorsoventral asymmetry in Antirrhinum. The Lcyc gene is extensively methylated and transcriptionally silent in the mutant. This modification is heritable and co-segregates with the mutant phenotype. Occasionally the mutant reverts phenotypically during somatic development, correlating with demethylation of Lcyc and restoration of gene expression. It is surprising that the first natural morphological mutant to be characterized should trace to methylation, given the rarity of this mutational mechanism in the laboratory. This indicates that epigenetic mutations may play a more significant role in evolution than has hitherto been suspected.}

We report a genomic sequencing method that provides positive identification of 5-methylcytosine residues and yields strand-specific sequences of individual molecules in genomic {DNA}. The method utilizes bisulfite-induced modification of genomic {DNA}, under conditions whereby cytosine is converted to uracil, but 5-methylcytosine remains nonreactive. The sequence under investigation is then amplified by {PCR} with two sets of strand-specific primers to yield a pair of fragments, one from each strand, in which all uracil and thymine residues have been amplified as thymine and only 5-methylcytosine residues have been amplified as cytosine. The {PCR} products can be sequenced directly to provide a strand-specific average sequence for the population of molecules or can be cloned and sequenced to provide methylation maps of single {DNA} molecules. We tested the method by defining the methylation status within single {DNA} strands of two closely spaced {CpG} dinucleotides in the promoter of the human kininogen gene. During the analysis, we encountered in sperm {DNA} an unusual methylation pattern, which suggests that the high methylation level of single-copy sequences in sperm may be locally modulated by binding of protein factors in germ-line cells.}

abstract = {{DNA} methylation is a major epigenetic modification of the genome that regulates crucial aspects of its function. Genomic methylation patterns in somatic differentiated cells are generally stable and heritable. However, in mammals there are at least two developmental periods-in germ cells and in preimplantation embryos-in which methylation patterns are reprogrammed genome wide, generating cells with a broad developmental potential. Epigenetic reprogramming in germ cells is critical for imprinting; reprogramming in early embryos also affects imprinting. Reprogramming is likely to have a crucial role in establishing nuclear totipotency in normal development and in cloned animals, and in the erasure of acquired epigenetic information. A role of reprogramming in stem cell differentiation is also envisaged. {DNA} methylation is one of the best-studied epigenetic modifications of {DNA} in all unicellular and multicellular organisms. In mammals and other vertebrates, methylation occurs predominantly at the symmetrical dinucleotide {CpG} (1-4). Symmetrical methylation and the discovery of a {DNA} methyltransferase that prefers a hemimethylated substrate, Dnmt1 (4), suggested a mechanism by which specific patterns of methylation in the genome could be maintained. Patterns imposed on the genome at defined developmental time points in precursor cells could be maintained by Dnmt1, and would lead to predetermined programs of gene expression during development in descendants of the precursor cells (5, 6). This provided a means to explain how patterns of differentiation could be maintained by populations of cells. In addition, specific demethylation events in differentiated tissues could then lead to further changes in gene expression as needed. Neat and convincing as this model is, it is still largely unsubstantiated. While effects of methylation on expression of specific genes, particularly imprinted ones (7) and some retrotransposons (8), have been demonstrated in vivo, it is still unclear whether or not methylation is involved in the control of gene expression during normal development (9-13). Although enzymes have been identified that can methylate {DNA} de novo (Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b) (14), it is unknown how specific patterns of methylation are established in the genome. Mechanisms for active demethylation have been suggested, but no enzymes have been identified that carry out this function in vivo (15-17). Genomewide alterations in methylation-brought about, for example, by knockouts of the methylase genes-result in embryo lethality or developmental defects, but the basis for abnormal development still remains to be discovered (7, 14). What is clear, however, is that in mammals there are developmental periods of genomewide reprogramming of methylation patterns in vivo. Typically, a substantial part of the genome is demethylated, and after some time remethylated, in a cell- or tissue-specific pattern. The developmental dynamics of these reprogramming events, as well as some of the enzymatic mechanisms involved and the biological purposes, are beginning to be understood. Here we look at what is known about reprogramming in mammals and discuss how it might relate to developmental potency and imprinting.}

Here we reveal the molecular logic underlying the retention of nucleosomes in mouse spermatozoa, which contain only 1\% residual histones. We observe high enrichment throughout the genome of nucleosomes at {CpG}-rich sequences that lack {DNA} methylation. Residual nucleosomes are largely composed of the histone H3.3 variant and are trimethylated at Lys4 of histone H3 ({H3K4me3}). Canonical H3.1 and H3.2 histones are also enriched at {CpG}-rich promoters marked by Polycomb-mediated {H3K27me3}, a modification predictive of gene repression in preimplantation embryos. Histone variant-specific nucleosome retention in sperm is strongly associated with nucleosome turnover in round spermatids. Our data show evolutionary conservation of the basic principles of nucleosome retention in mouse and human sperm, supporting a model of epigenetic inheritance by nucleosomes between generations.}

In this review we report our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with de novo {DNA} methylation in germ cells. We discuss recent discoveries connecting histone modifications, transcription and the {DNA} methylation machinery, and consider how these new findings could lead to a model for methylation establishment.

abstract = {Loss or gain of {DNA} methylation can affect gene expression and is sometimes transmitted across generations. Such epigenetic alterations are thus a possible source of heritable phenotypic variation in the absence of {DNA} sequence change. However, attempts to assess the prevalence of stable epigenetic variation in natural and experimental populations and to quantify its impact on complex traits have been hampered by the confounding effects of {DNA} sequence polymorphisms. To overcome this problem as much as possible, two parents with little {DNA} sequence differences, but contrasting {DNA} methylation profiles, were used to derive a panel of epigenetic Recombinant Inbred Lines ({epiRILs}) in the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The {epiRILs} showed variation and high heritability for flowering time and plant height ( approximately 30\%), as well as stable inheritance of multiple parental {DNA} methylation variants (epialleles) over at least eight generations. These findings provide a first rationale to identify epiallelic variants that contribute to heritable variation in complex traits using linkage or association studies. More generally, the demonstration that numerous epialleles across the genome can be stable over many generations in the absence of selection or extensive {DNA} sequence variation highlights the need to integrate epigenetic information into population genetics studies.}

Small {RNA}-induced gene silencing can persist over several generations via transgenerationally inherited small {RNA} molecules in C. elegans, but all known transgenerational silencing responses are directed against foreign {DNA} introduced into the organism. We found that starvation-induced developmental arrest, a natural and drastic environmental change, leads to the generation of small {RNAs} that are inherited through at least three consecutive generations. These small, endogenous, transgenerationally transmitted {RNAs} target genes with roles in nutrition. We defined genes that are essential for this multigenerational effect.

However, molecular mechanisms by which these marks may communicate experience-dependent information across generations are currently unknown. In our model of chronic paternal stress, we previously identified nine {microRNAs} ({miRs}) that were increased in the sperm of stressed sires and associated with reduced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ({HPA}) stress axis reactivity in offspring. In the current study, we rigorously examine the hypothesis that these sperm {miRs} function postfertilization to alter offspring stress responsivity and, using zygote microinjection of the nine specific {miRs}, demonstrated a remarkable recapitulation of the offspring stress dysregulation phenotype. Further, we associated long-term reprogramming of the hypothalamic transcriptome with {HPA} axis dysfunction, noting a marked decreased in the expression of extracellular matrix and collagen gene sets that may reflect an underlying change in blood-brain barrier permeability. We conclude by investigating the developmental impact of sperm {miRs} in early zygotes with single-cell amplification technology, identifying the targeted degradation of stored maternal {mRNA} transcripts including sirtuin 1 and ubiquitin protein ligase E3a, two genes with established function in chromatin remodeling, and this potent regulatory function of {miRs} postfertilization likely initiates a cascade of molecular events that eventually alters stress reactivity. Overall, these findings demonstrate a clear mechanistic role for sperm {miRs} in the transgenerational transmission of paternal lifetime experiences.}

Noncoding {DNA}, containing introns, repetitive elements, and potentially active transposable elements, requires effective mechanisms for its long-term silencing. Mammals appear to have taken advantage of the possibilities afforded by cytosine methylation to provide a heritable mechanism for altering {DNA}-protein interactions to assist in such silencing. Genes can be transcribed from methylation-free promoters even though adjacent transcribed and nontranscribed regions are extensively methylated. Gene promoters can be used and regulated while keeping noncoding {DNA}, including transposable elements, suppressed. Methylation is also used for long-term epigenetic silencing of X-linked and imprinted genes and can either increase or decrease the level of transcription, depending on whether the methylation inactivates a positive or negative regulatory element.}

abstract = {Environmental compounds are known to promote epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease in subsequent generations (F1-F3) following ancestral exposure during fetal gonadal sex determination. The current study was designed to determine if a mixture of plastic derived endocrine disruptor compounds bisphenol-A ({BPA}), bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate ({DEHP}) and dibutyl phthalate ({DBP}) at two different doses promoted epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease and associated {DNA} methylation epimutations in sperm. Gestating F0 generation females were exposed to either the "plastics" or "lower dose plastics" mixture during embryonic days 8 to 14 of gonadal sex determination and the incidence of adult onset disease was evaluated in F1 and F3 generation rats. There were significant increases in the incidence of total disease/abnormalities in F1 and F3 generation male and female animals from plastics lineages. Pubertal abnormalities, testis disease, obesity, and ovarian disease (primary ovarian insufficiency and polycystic ovaries) were increased in the F3 generation animals. Kidney and prostate disease were only observed in the direct fetally exposed F1 generation plastic lineage animals. Analysis of the plastics lineage F3 generation sperm epigenome previously identified 197 differential {DNA} methylation regions ({DMR}) in gene promoters, termed epimutations. A number of these transgenerational {DMR} form a unique direct connection gene network and have previously been shown to correlate with the pathologies identified. Observations demonstrate that a mixture of plastic derived compounds, {BPA} and phthalates, can promote epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease. The sperm {DMR} provide potential epigenetic biomarkers for transgenerational disease and/or ancestral environmental exposures.}

However, recent data argue that this reprogramming is incomplete and that substantial epigenetic information passes from one generation to the next.

Their self-renewal requires the maintenance of a defined gene-expression program, which must be stably adjusted towards a new fate upon differentiation. Recent data imply that epigenetic mechanisms can confer robustness to steady state gene expression but can also direct the terminal fate of lineage-restricted multipotent progenitor cells. Here, we review the latest models for how changes in chromatin and {DNA} methylation are regulated during cellular differentiation. We further propose that targets of epigenetic repression share common features in the sequences of their regulatory regions, thereby suggesting a co-evolution of epigenetic pathways and classes of cis-acting elements.}

As in mammals, the majority of Drosophila {piRNAs} are derived from discrete genomic loci. These loci comprise mainly defective transposon sequences, and some have previously been identified as master regulators of transposon activity. Our data suggest that heterochromatic {piRNA} loci interact with potentially active, euchromatic transposons to form an adaptive system for transposon control. Complementary relationships between sense and antisense {piRNA} populations suggest an amplification loop wherein each {piRNA}-directed cleavage event generates the 5' end of a new {piRNA}. Thus, sense {piRNAs}, formed following cleavage of transposon {mRNAs} may enhance production of antisense {piRNAs}, complementary to active elements, by directing cleavage of transcripts from master control loci.}

abstract = {The germline represents a unique cell type that can transmit genetic material to the next generation. During early embryonic development, somatic cells give rise to a small population of cells known as germ cells, which eventually differentiate into mature gametes. Germ cells undergo a process of removing and resetting relevant epigenetic information, mainly by {DNA} demethylation. This extensive epigenetic reprogramming leads to the conversion of germ cells into immortal cells that can pass on the genome to the next generation. In the absence of germline-specific reprogramming, germ cells would preserve the old, parental epigenetic memory, which would prevent the transfer of heritable information to the offspring. On the contrary, somatic cells cannot reset epigenetic information by preserving the full methylation pattern on imprinting genes. In this review, we focus on the capacity of germ cells and somatic cells (soma) to transfer genetic information to the next generation, and thus revisit the Weismann theory of heredity.

abstract = {Phenotypic variation that cannot be explained by genetic or environmental heterogeneity has intrigued geneticists for decades. The molecular basis of this phenomenon, however, is largely a mystery. Axin-fused (Axin(Fu)), first identified in 1937, is a classic example of a mammalian allele displaying extremely variable expression states. Here we demonstrate that the presence or absence of its characteristic phenotype, a kinked tail, correlates with differential {DNA} methylation at a retrotransposon within Axin(Fu) and identify mutant transcripts arising adjacent to the retrotransposon {LTR} that are likely to be causative of the phenotype. Furthermore, the epigenetic state at Axin(Fu) can be inherited transgenerationally after both maternal and paternal transmission. This is in contrast to epigenetic inheritance at the murine agouti-viable yellow (A(vy)) allele, which occurs through the female only. Unlike the egg, the sperm contributes very little (if any) cytoplasm to the zygote, and therefore paternal inheritance at Axin(Fu) argues against the possibility that the effects are due to cytoplasmic or metabolic influences. Consistent with the idea of transgenerational inheritance of epigenetic marks, we find that the methylation state of Axin(Fu) in mature sperm reflects the methylation state of the allele in the somatic tissue of the animal, suggesting that it does not undergo epigenetic reprogramming during gametogenesis. Finally, we show that epigenetic inheritance is influenced by strain background. These findings enable us to propose a model for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in mammals.}

In early embryos many single-copy sequences become demethylated both by active and passive demethylation, whereas imprinted gene methylation remains unaffected. In primordial germ cells single-copy and imprinted sequences are demethylated, presumably by active demethylation. Here we investigated systematically by bisulphite sequencing the methylation profiles of {IAP} and Line1 repeated sequence families during preimplantation and primordial germ cell development. Whereas Line1 elements were substantially demethylated during both developmental periods, {IAP} elements were largely resistant to demethylation, particularly during preimplantation development. This may be desirable in order to prevent {IAP} retrotransposition, which could cause mutations. In turn, this can result in the transgenerational inheritance of epigenetic states of {IAPs}, which could lead to heritable epimutations of neighbouring genes through influencing their transcriptional states.

We find that "epivariation," either stochastic or due to unknown demographic or environmental factors, was a far stronger contributor to the sperm methylome than was the diet consumed. Variation in cytosine methylation was particularly dramatic over tandem repeat families, including ribosomal {DNA} ({rDNA}) repeats, but {rDNA} methylation was strongly correlated with genetic variation in {rDNA} copy number and was not influenced by paternal diet.

These silent genes can be reactivated at high frequency by the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine (5-aza-{CR}). The inactive and active epigenetic states of such genes are stably inherited. A method for silencing genes is now available. It involves treatment of permeabilized cells with 5-methyl deoxycytidine triphosphate (5-methyl {dCTP}) which is incorporated into {DNA}. The methylation of promoter sequences has been confirmed using the bisulfite genomic sequencing procedure. Methylated oligonucleotides homologous to promoter sequences might be used to specifically target and silence given genes, but results so far have not been conclusive. Treatments that silence or reactivate genes by changing {DNA} methylation can be referred to as epimutagens, as distinct from mutagens that act by changing {DNA} sequences. The epimutagen 5-aza-{CR} reactivates genes but has little mutagenic activity, whereas standard mutagens (such as ethyl methane sulfonate and ultraviolet light) have little reactivation activity. Nevertheless, much more information is required about the effects of {DNA}-damaging agents in changing {DNA} methylation and gene activity and also about the role of epimutations in tumor progression.}

To achieve this high degree of packaging, sperm {DNA} interacts with protamines to form linear, side-by-side arrays of chromatin. This differs markedly from the bulkier {DNA} packaging of somatic cell nuclei and mitotic chromosomes, in which the {DNA} is coiled around histone octamers to form nucleosomes. The overall organization of mammalian sperm {DNA}, however, resembles that of somatic cells in that both the linear arrays of sperm chromatin and the 30-nm solenoid filaments of somatic cell chromatin are organized into loop domains attached at their bases to a nuclear matrix. In addition to the sperm nuclear matrix, sperm nuclei contain a unique structure termed the sperm nuclear annulus to which the entire complement of {DNA} appears to be anchored when the nuclear matrix is disrupted during decondensation. In somatic cells, proper function of {DNA} is dependent upon the structural organization of the {DNA} by the nuclear matrix, and the structural organization of sperm {DNA} is likely to be just as vital to the proper functioning of the spermatozoa.}

Metastable epialleles refer to loci that intrinsically behave in this way and a few examples have been described. They display differential methylation in association with differential expression. For example, inbred mice carrying the agouti viable yellow (A (vy) ) allele show a range of coat colours associated with different {DNA} methylation states at the locus. The availability of next-generation sequencing, in particular whole genome sequencing of bisulphite converted {DNA}, allows us, for the first time, to search for metastable epialleles at base pair resolution. {RESULTS}: Using whole genome bisulphite sequencing of {DNA} from the livers of five mice from the A (vy) colony, we searched for sites at which {DNA} methylation differed among the mice. A small number of loci, 356, were detected and we call these inter-individual Differentially Methylated Regions, {iiDMRs}, 55 of which overlap with endogenous retroviral elements ({ERVs}). Whole genome resequencing of two mice from the colony identified very few differences and these did not occur at or near the {iiDMRs}. Further work suggested that the majority of {ERV} {iiDMRs} are metastable epialleles; the level of methylation was maintained in tissue from other germ layers and the level of {mRNA} from the neighbouring gene inversely correlated with methylation state. Most {iiDMRs} that were not overlapping {ERV} insertions occurred at tissue-specific {DMRs} and it cannot be ruled out that these are driven by changes in the ratio of cell types in the tissues analysed. {CONCLUSIONS}: Using the most thorough genome-wide profiling technologies for differentially methylated regions, we find very few intrinsically epigenetically variable regions that we term {iiDMRs}. The most robust of these are at retroviral elements and appear to be metastable epialleles. The non-{ERV} {iiDMRs} cannot be described as metastable epialleles at this stage but provide a novel class of variably methylated elements for further study.}

Definition of the oocyte {DNA} methylome by whole genome approaches revealed that the majority of methylated {CpG} islands are intragenic and gene bodies are hypermethylated. Yet, the mechanisms by which transcription regulates {DNA} methylation in oocytes remain unclear. Here, we systematically test the link between transcription and the methylome. {RESULTS}: We perform deep {RNA}-Seq and de novo transcriptome assembly at different stages of mouse oogenesis. This reveals thousands of novel non-annotated genes, as well as alternative promoters, for approximately 10 \% of reference genes expressed in oocytes. In addition, a large fraction of novel promoters coincide with {MaLR} and {ERVK} transposable elements. Integration with our transcriptome assembly reveals that transcription correlates accurately with {DNA} methylation and accounts for approximately 85-90 \% of the methylome. We generate a mouse model in which transcription across the Zac1/Plagl1 locus is abrogated in oocytes, resulting in failure of {DNA} methylation establishment at all {CpGs} of this locus. {ChIP} analysis in oocytes reveals {H3K4me2} enrichment at the Zac1 imprinted control region when transcription is ablated, establishing a connection between transcription and chromatin remodeling at {CpG} islands by histone demethylases. {CONCLUSIONS}: By precisely defining the mouse oocyte transcriptome, this work not only highlights transcription as a cornerstone of {DNA} methylation establishment in female germ cells, but also provides an important resource for developmental biology research.}

Existing gene set tests that rely on gene permutation are shown here to be extremely sensitive to inter-gene correlation. Several data sets are analyzed to show that inter-gene correlation is non-ignorable even for experiments on homogeneous cell populations using genetically identical model organisms. A new gene set test procedure ({CAMERA}) is proposed based on the idea of estimating the inter-gene correlation from the data, and using it to adjust the gene set test statistic. An efficient procedure is developed for estimating the inter-gene correlation and characterizing its precision. {CAMERA} is shown to control the type I error rate correctly regardless of inter-gene correlations, yet retains excellent power for detecting genuine differential expression. Analysis of breast cancer data shows that {CAMERA} recovers known relationships between tumor subtypes in very convincing terms. {CAMERA} can be used to analyze specified sets or as a pathway analysis tool using a database of molecular signatures.}

abstract = {Regularized generalized canonical correlation analysis ({RGCCA}) is a generalization of regularized canonical correlation analysis to 3 or more sets of variables. {RGCCA} is a component-based approach which aims to study the relationships between several sets of variables. The quality and interpretability of the {RGCCA} components are likely to be affected by the usefulness and relevance of the variables in each block. Therefore, it is an important issue to identify within each block which subsets of significant variables are active in the relationships between blocks. In this paper, {RGCCA} is extended to address the issue of variable selection. Specifically, sparse generalized canonical correlation analysis ({SGCCA}) is proposed to combine {RGCCA} with an [Formula: see text]-penalty in a unified framework. Within this framework, blocks are not necessarily fully connected, which makes {SGCCA} a flexible method for analyzing a wide variety of practical problems. Finally, the versatility and usefulness of {SGCCA} are illustrated on a simulated dataset and on a 3-block dataset which combine gene expression, comparative genomic hybridization, and a qualitative phenotype measured on a set of 53 children with glioma. {SGCCA} is available on {CRAN} as part of the {RGCCA} package. \copyright The Author 2014.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Variable selection on high throughput biological data, such as gene expression or single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}), becomes inevitable to select relevant information and, therefore, to better characterize diseases or assess genetic structure. There are different ways to perform variable selection in large data sets. Statistical tests are commonly used to identify differentially expressed features for explanatory purposes, whereas Machine Learning wrapper approaches can be used for predictive purposes. In the case of multiple highly correlated variables, another option is to use multivariate exploratory approaches to give more insight into cell biology, biological pathways or complex traits. {RESULTS}: A simple extension of a sparse {PLS} exploratory approach is proposed to perform variable selection in a multiclass classification framework. {CONCLUSIONS}: {sPLS}-{DA} has a classification performance similar to other wrapper or sparse discriminant analysis approaches on public microarray and {SNP} data sets. More importantly, {sPLS}-{DA} is clearly competitive in terms of computational efficiency and superior in terms of interpretability of the results via valuable graphical outputs. {sPLS}-{DA} is available in the R package {mixOmics}, which is dedicated to the analysis of large biological data sets.}

abstract = {Inheritance is typically associated with the Mendelian transmission of information from parents to offspring by alleles ({DNA} sequence). However, empirical data clearly suggest that traits can be acquired from ancestors by mechanisms that do not involve genetic alleles, referred to as non-genetic inheritance. Information that is non-genetically transmitted across generations includes parental experience and exposure to certain environments, but also parental mutations and polymorphisms, because they can change the parental 'intrinsic' environment. Non-genetic inheritance is not limited to the first generation of the progeny, but can involve the grandchildren and even further generations. Non-genetic inheritance has been observed for multiple traits including overall development, cardiovascular risk and metabolic symptoms, but this review will focus on the inheritance of behavioral abnormalities pertinent to psychiatric disorders. Multigenerational non-genetic inheritance is often interpreted as the transmission of epigenetic marks, such as {DNA} methylation and chromatin modifications, via the gametes (transgenerational epigenetic inheritance). However, information can be carried across generations by a large number of bioactive substances, including hormones, cytokines, and even microorganisms, without the involvement of the gametes. We reason that this broader definition of non-genetic inheritance is more appropriate, especially in the context of psychiatric disorders, because of the well-recognized role of parental and early life environmental factors in later life psychopathology. Here we discuss the various forms of non-genetic inheritance in humans and animals, as well as rodent models of psychiatric conditions to illustrate possible mechanisms.}

The previous study showing a major effect of paternal obesity on metabolic health of offspring is confounded by comorbidity with diabetes. Therefore, we investigated the effect of diet-induced paternal obesity, in the absence of diabetes, on the metabolic health of two resultant generations and the molecular profiles of the testes and sperm. Founder (F0) male {C57BL6} mice were fed either a high-fat diet ({HFD}) or a control diet ({CD}); n = 10/diet for a period of 10 wk. Testis expression of {mRNA}/{microRNAs} was analyzed by microarray and {qPCR} and sperm {microRNA} abundance by {qPCR}. Two subsequent generations were generated by mating F0 and then F1 mice to {CD} mice, and their metabolic health was investigated. All mice, other than F0 males, were maintained on a {CD}. {HFD} feeding induced paternal obesity with a 21\% increase in adiposity, but not overt diabetes, and initiated intergenerational transmission of obesity and insulin resistance in two generations of offspring. This distinct phenotypic constellation is either partially or fully transmitted to both female and male F1 offspring and further transmitted through both parental lineages to the F2 generation, with a heightened effect on female F1 offspring (+67\% in adiposity) and their F2 sons (+24\% in adiposity). Founder male obesity altered the testes expression of 414 {mRNAs} by microarray and 11 {microRNAs} by {qPCR}, concomitant with alterations in sperm {microRNA} content and a 25\% reduction in global methylation of germ cell {DNA}. Diet-induced paternal obesity modulates sperm {microRNA} content and germ cell methylation status, which are potential signals that program offspring health and initiate the transmission of obesity and impaired metabolic health to future generations. This study implicates paternal obesity in the transgenerational amplification of obesity and type 2 diabetes in humans.}

The observed molecular hallmarks of the germline reprogramming exhibit intriguing similarities to other dedifferentiation or regeneration systems, pointing towards the existence of unifying molecular pathways underlying cell fate reversal.

abstract = {The {DNA} of each cell is wrapped around histone octamers, forming so-called 'nucleosomal core particles'. These histone proteins have tails that project from the nucleosome and many residues in these tails can be post-translationally modified, influencing all {DNA}-based processes, including chromatin compaction, nucleosome dynamics, and transcription. In contrast to those present in histone tails, modifications in the core regions of the histones had remained largely uncharacterised until recently, when some of these modifications began to be analysed in detail. Overall, recent work has shown that histone core modifications can not only directly regulate transcription, but also influence processes such as {DNA} repair, replication, stemness, and changes in cell state. In this review, we focus on the most recent developments in our understanding of histone modifications, particularly those on the lateral surface of the nucleosome. This region is in direct contact with the {DNA} and is formed by the histone cores. We suggest that these lateral surface modifications represent a key insight into chromatin regulation in the cell. Therefore, lateral surface modifications form a key area of interest and a focal point of ongoing study in epigenetics. Copyright \copyright 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

These findings support the hypothesis that a histone code uses histone post-translational modifications to stably inscribe particular chromatin structures into the genome. Experiments on the dynamics of histone modifications reveal a striking kinetic difference between methylation, phosphorylation and acetylation, suggesting different roles of these modifications in epigenetically fixing specific gene expression patterns.

Surprisingly, transposons that were immobile in the parental lines displayed stochastic movement in 28\% of the {epiRILs}. Although analysis after eight generations of inbreeding, supported by genome-wide {DNA} methylation profiling, identified recombined parental chromosomal segments, these were interspersed with unexpectedly high frequencies of nonparental methylation polymorphism. Hence, epigenetic inheritance in hybrids derived from parents with divergent epigenomes permits long-lasting epi-allelic interactions that violate Mendelian expectations.

Whereas several epigenetic factors have been implicated in germline transmission, mediators of information transfer from soma to the germline remain unidentified in mammals. Notably, a recent bioinformatic analysis showed association of extracellular {microRNAs} ({miRNAs}) and altered transcriptomes in diverse instances of mammalian epigenetic inheritance involving different environmental factors, tissues, life cycle stages, generations and genders. It was predicted that regulatory non-coding {RNAs} ({ncRNAs}) may potentially mediate soma to germline information transfer. Remarkably, the present bioinformatic evidence suggests similar association of exosomal {mRNAs} and proteins. The differentially expressed genes reported previously in genome level expression profiling studies related to or relevant in epigenetic inheritance showed enrichment for documented set of exosomal {mRNAs} in a few instances of epigenetic inheritance and of exosomal proteins in a majority of instances. Differentially expressed genes encoding exosomal {miRNAs} and proteins, directly or indirectly through first and/or second degree interactome networks, overrepresented biological processes related to environmental factors used in these instances as well as to epigenetic alterations, especially chromatin and histone modifications. These findings predict that exosomal {mRNAs} and proteins, like extracellular {miRNAs}, may also potentially mediate soma to germline information transfer. A convergent conceptual model is presented wherein extracellular {ncRNAs}/{miRNA}, {mRNAs} and proteins provide the much needed continuum inclusive of epigenetic inheritance.

Massively parallel sequencing is increasingly used to infer copy number information from variations in the read depth in sequencing data. However, this approach has limitations in the case of targeted re-sequencing, which leaves gaps in coverage between the regions chosen for enrichment and introduces biases related to the efficiency of target capture and library preparation. We present a method for copy number detection, implemented in the software package {CNVkit}, that uses both the targeted reads and the nonspecifically captured off-target reads to infer copy number evenly across the genome. This combination achieves both exon-level resolution in targeted regions and sufficient resolution in the larger intronic and intergenic regions to identify copy number changes. In particular, we successfully inferred copy number at equivalent to 100-kilobase resolution genome-wide from a platform targeting as few as 293 genes. After normalizing read counts to a pooled reference, we evaluated and corrected for three sources of bias that explain most of the extraneous variability in the sequencing read depth: {GC} content, target footprint size and spacing, and repetitive sequences. We compared the performance of {CNVkit} to copy number changes identified by array comparative genomic hybridization. We packaged the components of {CNVkit} so that it is straightforward to use and provides visualizations, detailed reporting of significant features, and export options for integration into existing analysis pipelines. {CNVkit} is freely available from https://github.com/etal/cnvkit.}

However, a short single pulse of {GAL4} during embryogenesis is sufficient to release {PcG}-dependent silencing from the transgene. Such an activated state of Fab-7 is mitotically inheritable through development and can be transmitted in a {GAL4}-independent manner to the subsequent generations through female meiosis.

abstract = {{MicroRNA} ({miRNA}) levels in serum have recently emerged as potential novel biomarkers for various diseases. {miRNAs} are routinely measured by standard quantitative real-time {PCR} ({qPCR}); however, the high sensitivity of {qPCR} demands appropriate normalization to correct for nonbiological variation. Presently, {RNU6B} (U6) is used for data normalization of circulating {miRNAs} in many studies. However, it was suggested that serum levels of U6 themselves might differ between individuals. Therefore, no consensus has been reached on the best normalization strategy in 'circulating {miRNA}'. We analyzed U6 levels as well as levels of spiked-in {SV40}-{RNA} in sera of 44 healthy volunteers, 203 intensive care unit patients and 64 patients with liver fibrosis. Levels of U6 demonstrated a high variability in sera of healthy donors, patients with critical illness and liver fibrosis. This high variability could also be confirmed in sera of mice after the cecal ligation and puncture procedure. Most importantly, levels of circulating U6 were significantly upregulated in sera of patients with critical illness and sepsis compared with controls and correlated with established markers of inflammation. In patients with liver fibrosis, U6 levels were significantly downregulated. In contrast, levels of spiked-in {SV40} displayed a significantly higher stability both in human cohorts (healthy, critical illness, liver fibrosis) and in mice. Thus, we conclude that U6 levels in the serum are dysregulated in a disease-specific manner. Therefore, U6 should not be used for data normalization of circulating {miRNAs} in inflammatory diseases and previous studies using this approach should be interpreted with caution. Further studies are warranted to identify specific regulatory processes of U6 levels in sepsis and liver fibrosis.}

abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: Chronic and high consumption of fat constitutes an environmental stress that leads to metabolic diseases. We hypothesized that high-fat diet ({HFD}) transgenerationally remodels the epigenome of spermatozoa and metabolism of the offspring. {METHODS}: F0-male rats fed either {HFD} or chow diet for 12 weeks were mated with chow-fed dams to generate F1 and F2 offspring. Motile spermatozoa were isolated from F0 and F1 breeders to determine {DNA} methylation and small non-coding {RNA} ({sncRNA}) expression pattern by deep sequencing. {RESULTS}: Newborn offspring of {HFD}-fed fathers had reduced body weight and pancreatic beta-cell mass. Adult female, but not male, offspring of {HFD}-fed fathers were glucose intolerant and resistant to {HFD}-induced weight gain. This phenotype was perpetuated in the F2 progeny, indicating transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. The epigenome of spermatozoa from {HFD}-fed F0 and their F1 male offspring showed common {DNA} methylation and small non-coding {RNA} expression signatures. Altered expression of sperm {miRNA} let-7c was passed down to metabolic tissues of the offspring, inducing a transcriptomic shift of the let-7c predicted targets. {CONCLUSION}: Our results provide insight into mechanisms by which {HFD} transgenerationally reprograms the epigenome of sperm cells, thereby affecting metabolic tissues of offspring throughout two generations.}

abstract = {Sperm is a highly differentiated cell type whose function is to deliver a haploid genome to the oocyte. The sperm "epigenomes" were traditionally considered to be insignificant - the sperm is transcriptionally inactive, its genome is packaged in sperm-specific protamine toroids instead of nucleosomes, and its {DNA} methylation profile is erased immediately post-fertilization. Yet, in recent years there has been an increase in the number of reported cases of apparent epigenetic inheritance through the male germline, suggesting that the sperm epigenome may transmit information between generations. At the same time, technical advances have made the genome-wide profiling of different layers of the sperm epigenome feasible. As a result, a large number of datasets have been recently generated and analyzed with the aim to better understand what non-genetic material is contained within the sperm and whether it has any function post-fertilization. Here, we provide an overview of the current knowledge of the sperm epigenomes as well as the challenges in analysing them and the opportunities in understanding the potential non-genetic carriers of information in sperm.}

Recent papers argue that epigenetic marks acquired through experience are passed to offspring, but as in much of the field of epigenetics, there is lack of precision in the definitions and perhaps too much eagerness to translate animal research to humans. Here, we review operational definitions of transgenerational inheritance and the processes of epigenetic programing during early development. Subsequently, based on this background, we critically examine some recent findings of studies investigating transgenerational inheritance. Finally, we discuss possible mechanisms that may explain transgenerational inheritance, including transmission of an epigenetic blueprint, which may predispose offspring to specific epigenetic patterning. Taken together, we conclude that presently, the evidence suggesting that acquired epigenetic marks are passed to the subsequent generation remains limited.}

In turn, lipids can directly influence the organelle membrane properties by changing biophysical parameters and by recruiting partner effector proteins involved in protein sorting and membrane dynamics.

Release of extracellular vesicles from its cell of origin occurs either through the outward budding of the plasma membrane or through the inward budding of the endosomal membrane, resulting in the formation of multivesicular bodies, which release vesicles upon fusion with the plasma membrane. The release of vesicles can facilitate intercellular communication by contact with or by internalization of contents, either by fusion with the plasma membrane or by endocytosis into "recipient" cells. Although the interest in extracellular vesicle research is increasing, there are still no real standards in place to separate or classify the different types of vesicles.

In {RNA}-Seq however the artifactual reads are not easy to tell apart from normal read duplication due to natural over-sequencing of highly expressed genes. Especially when working with little input material or single cells assessing the fraction of duplicate reads is an important quality control step for {NGS} data sets. Up to now there are only tools to calculate the global duplication rates that do not take into account the effect of gene expression levels which leaves them of limited use for {RNA}-Seq data. {RESULTS}: Here we present the tool {dupRadar}, which provides an easy means to distinguish the fraction of reads originating in natural duplication due to high expression from the fraction induced by artefacts. {dupRadar} assesses the fraction of duplicate reads per gene dependent on the expression level.

abstract = {Haploid male germ cells package their {DNA} into a volume that is typically 10\% or less that of a somatic cell nucleus. To achieve this remarkable level of compaction, spermatozoa replace most of their histones with smaller, highly basic arginine and (in eutherians) cysteine rich protamines. One reason for such a high level of compaction is that it may help optimise nuclear shape and hence support the gametes' swimming ability for the long journey across the female reproductive tract to the oocyte. Super-compaction of the genome may confer additional protection from the effects of genotoxic factors. However, many species including the human retain a fraction of their chromatin in the more relaxed nucleosomal configuration that appears to run counter to the ergonomic, toroidal and repackaging of sperm {DNA}. Recent research suggests that the composition of this 'residual' nucleosomal compartment, a generally overlooked feature of the male gamete, is far more significant and important than previously thought. In this respect, the transport and incorporation of modified paternal histones by the spermatozoon to the zygote has been demonstrated and indicates another potential paternal effect in the epigenetic reprogramming of the zygote following fertilisation that is independent of imprinting status. In this review, the most recent research into mammalian spermatozoal chromatin composition is discussed alongside evidence for conserved, non-randomly located nucleosomal domains in spermatozoal nuclei, all supporting the hypothesis that the spermatozoon delivers a novel epigenetic signature to the egg that may be crucial for normal development. We also provide some thoughts on why this signature may be required in early embryogenesis.}

Distinct patterns of histone modification are observed at specific chromosomal regions and affect various reactions on chromosomes (transcription, replication, repair, and recombination). Histone modification has long been proposed to have a profound effect on eukaryotic gene expression since its discovery in 1964. Verification of this idea, however, was difficult until the identification of enzymes responsible for histone modifications. Ten years ago (1995), histone acetyltransferases ({HATs}), which acetylate lysine residues in histone amino-terminal tail regions, were isolated. {HATs} are involved in the regulation of both promoter-specific transcription and long-range/chromosome-wide transcription. Analyses of {HATs} and other modification enzymes have revealed mechanisms of epigenetic regulation that are mediated by post-translational modifications of histones. Here we review some major advances in the field, with emphasis on the lysine specificity of the acetylation reaction and on the regulation of gene expression over broad regions.}

One of the key steps in {sRNA}-seq data analysis is alignment to a reference genome. {sRNA}-seq libraries often have a high proportion of reads that align to multiple genomic locations, which makes determining their true origins difficult. Commonly used {sRNA}-seq alignment methods result in either very low precision (choosing an alignment at random), or sensitivity (ignoring multi-mapping reads). Here, we describe and test an {sRNA}-seq alignment strategy that uses local genomic context to guide decisions on proper placements of multi-mapped {sRNA}-seq reads. Tests using simulated {sRNA}-seq data demonstrated that this local-weighting method outperforms other alignment strategies using three different plant genomes. Experimental analyses with real {sRNA}-seq data also indicate superior performance of local-weighting methods for both plant {miRNAs} and heterochromatic {siRNAs}. The local-weighting methods we have developed are implemented as part of the {sRNA}-seq analysis program {ShortStack}, which is freely available under a general public license.

abstract = {Paramutation and transposon silencing are two epigenetic phenomena that have intrigued and puzzled geneticists for decades. Each involves heritable changes in gene activity without changes in {DNA} sequence. Here we report the cloning of a gene whose activity is required for the maintenance of both silenced transposons and paramutated color genes in maize. We show that this gene, Mop1 (Mediator of paramutation1) codes for a putative {RNA}-dependent {RNA} polymerase, whose activity is required for the production of small {RNAs} that correspond to the {MuDR} transposon sequence. We also demonstrate that although Mop1 is required to maintain {MuDR} methylation and silencing, it is not required for the initiation of heritable silencing. In contrast, we present evidence that a reduction in the transcript level of a maize homolog of the nucleosome assembly protein 1 histone chaperone can reduce the heritability of {MuDR} silencing. Together, these data suggest that the establishment and maintenance of {MuDR} silencing have distinct requirements.}

abstract = {Gene set enrichment analysis ({GSEA}) is an ubiquitously used tool for evaluating pathway enrichment in transcriptional data. Typical experimental design consists in comparing two conditions with several replicates using a differential gene expression test followed by preranked {GSEA} performed against a collection of hundreds and thousands of pathways. However, the reference implementation of this method cannot accurately estimate small P-values, which significantly limits its sensitivity due to multiple hypotheses correction procedure. Here we present {FGSEA} (Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) method that is able to estimate arbitrarily low {GSEA} P-values with a high accuracy in a matter of minutes or even seconds. To confirm the accuracy of the method, we also developed an exact algorithm for {GSEA} P-values calculation for integer gene-level statistics. Using the exact algorithm as a reference we show that {FGSEA} is able to routinely estimate P-values up to 10 −100 with a small and predictable estimation error. We systematically evaluate {FGSEA} on a collection of 605 datasets and show that {FGSEA} recovers much more statistically significant pathways compared to other implementations. {FGSEA} is open source and available as an R package in Bioconductor ( http://bioconductor.org/packages/fgsea/ ) and on {GitHub} ( https://github.com/ctlab/fgsea/ ).}

We identified a total of 26 post-translational modifications ({PTMs}) on specific residues of the core histones {H2B}, H3 and H4, and the linker histone H1, four of which had not been described previously in any tissue or cell line. We also detected 11 novel {PTMs} on the protamines {PRM1} and {PRM2} and observed that they are present in specific combinations on individual protamines. {CONCLUSIONS}: Both histones and protamines carry multiple {PTMs} in the adult mouse sperm. On protamines, specific {PTM} combinations might form a 'protamine code' similar to the 'histone code'. These findings suggest a potential role for {PTMs} on sperm histones and protamines in epigenetic signatures underlying transgenerational inheritance.}

abstract = {The mammalian sperm genome is thought to lack substantial information for the regulation of future expression after fertilization. Here, we show that most promoters in mouse sperm are flanked by well-positioned nucleosomes marked by active histone modifications. Analysis of these modifications suggests that many enhancers and super-enhancers functional in embryonic and adult tissues are already specified in sperm. The sperm genome is bound by {CTCF} and cohesin at sites that are also present in round spermatids and embryonic stem cells ({ESCs}). These sites mediate interactions that organize the sperm genome into domains and compartments that overlap extensively with those found in {mESCs}. These results suggest that sperm carry a rich source of regulatory information, encoded in part by its three-dimensional folding specified by {CTCF} and cohesin. This information may contribute to future expression during embryonic and adult life, suggesting mechanisms by which environmental effects on the paternal germline are transmitted transgenerationally.

This unique chromatin packaging at certain gene promoters provides these genomic loci the ability to convey instructive epigenetic information to the zygote, potentially expanding the role and significance of the sperm epigenome in embryogenesis. We hypothesize that changes in chromatin packaging may be associated with poor reproductive outcome. {METHODS}: Seven patients with reproductive dysfunction were recruited: three had unexplained poor embryogenesis during {IVF} and four were diagnosed with male infertility and previously shown to have altered protamination. Genome-wide analysis of the location of histones and histone modifications was analyzed by isolation and purification of {DNA} bound to histones and protamines. The histone-bound fraction of {DNA} was analyzed using high-throughput sequencing, both initially and following chromatin immunoprecipitation. The protamine-bound fraction was hybridized to agilent arrays. {DNA} methylation was examined using bisulfite sequencing. {RESULTS}: Unlike fertile men, five of seven infertile men had non-programmatic (randomly distributed) histone retention genome-wide. Interestingly, in contrast to the total histone pool, the localization of H3 Lysine 4 methylation ({H3K4me}) or H3 Lysine 27 methylation ({H3K27me}) was highly similar in the gametes of infertile men compared with fertile men. However, there was a reduction in the amount of {H3K4me} or {H3K27me} retained at developmental transcription factors and certain imprinted genes. Finally, the methylation status of candidate developmental promoters and imprinted loci were altered in a subset of the infertile men. {CONCLUSIONS}: This initial genome-wide analysis of epigenetic markings in the sperm of infertile men demonstrates differences in composition and epigenetic markings compared with fertile men, especially at certain imprinted and developmental loci. Although no single locus displays a complete change in chromatin packaging or {DNA} modification, the data suggest that moderate changes throughout the genome exist and may have a cumulative detrimental effect on fecundity.}

Epigenetic marks are mitotically inherited in somatic cells and may be altered in response to internal and external stimuli. The idea that environment-induced epigenetic changes in mammals could be inherited through the germline, independent of genetic mechanisms, has stimulated much debate. Many experimental models have been designed to interrogate the possibility of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance and provide insight into how environmental exposures influence phenotypes over multiple generations in the absence of any apparent genetic mutation. Unexpected molecular evidence has forced us to reevaluate not only our understanding of the plasticity and heritability of epigenetic factors, but of the stability of the genome as well. Recent reviews have described the difference between transgenerational and intergenerational effects; the two major epigenetic reprogramming events in the mammalian lifecycle; these two events making transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of environment-induced perturbations rare, if at all possible, in mammals; and mechanisms of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in non-mammalian eukaryotic organisms. This paper briefly introduces these topics and mainly focuses on (1) transgenerational phenotypes and epigenetic effects in mammals, (2) environment-induced intergenerational epigenetic effects, and (3) the inherent difficulties in establishing a role for epigenetic inheritance in human environmental disease.

This non-genetic form of inheritance is termed epigenetic transgenerational inheritance and has been shown in a variety of species including plants, flies, worms, fish, rodents, pigs, and humans. This phenomenon operates during specific critical windows of exposure, linked to the developmental biology of the germ cells (sperm and eggs). Therefore, concepts of the developmental origins of transgenerational inheritance of phenotypic variation and subsequent disease risk need to include epigenetic processes affecting the developmental biology of the germ cell. These developmental impacts on epigenetic transgenerational inheritance, in contrast to multigenerational exposures, are the focus of this Perspective.}

Epigenetic marks, including {DNA} methylation, histones, chromatin structure, and noncoding {RNAs}, are modified throughout life in response to environmental and behavioral influences. With each new generation, {DNA} methylation patterns are erased in gametes and reset after fertilization, probably to prevent these epigenetic marks from being transferred from parents to their offspring. However, some recent animal studies suggest an apparent resistance to complete erasure of epigenetic marks during early development, enabling transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. Whether there are similar mechanisms in humans remains unclear, with the exception of epigenetic imprinting. Nevertheless, a distinctly different mechanism-namely, intrauterine exposure to environmental stressors that may affect establishment of the newly composing epigenetic patterns after fertilization-is often confused with transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. In this review, we delineate the definition of and requirement for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, differentiate it from the consequences of intrauterine exposure, and discuss the available evidence in both animal models and humans.-Van Otterdijk, S.

We have performed heterologous {ICSI} by injecting human sperm into mouse oocytes. Probing these zygotes with an antibody highly specific for the H3.1/H3.2 replication variants showed a clear signal in the decondensed human sperm chromatin prior to S-phase. In addition, staining of human multipronuclear zygotes also showed the H3.1/H3.2 replication variants in paternal chromatin prior to {DNA} replication. {CONCLUSION}: these findings reveal that sperm-derived nucleosomal chromatin contributes to paternal zygotic chromatin, potentially serving as a template for replication, when epigenetic information can be copied. Hence, the execution of epigenetic programs originating from transmitted paternal chromatin during subsequent embryonic development is a logical consequence of this observation.}

We also observe higher library diversity generated by Tn5-059 when compared to Nextera v2 for human exomes, which leads to less sequencing and lower cost per genome. In addition, when used for human exomes, Tn5-059 delivers consistent library insert size over a range of input {DNA}, allowing up to a tenfold variance from the 50 ng input recommendation. {CONCLUSIONS}: Enhanced {DNA} input tolerance of Tn5-059 can translate to flexibility and robustness of workflow. {DNA} input tolerance together with superior uniformity of coverage and lower {AT} dropouts extend the applications of transposase based library preps. We discuss possible mechanisms of improvements in Tn5-059, and potential advantages of using the new mutant in varieties of applications including microbiome sequencing and chromatin profiling.}

abstract = {Precise separation of spermatogonial stem cells ({\SSCs}) from progenitor spermatogonia that lack stem cell activity and are committed to differentiation remains a challenge. To distinguish between these spermatogonial subtypes, we identified genes that exhibited bimodal {mRNA} levels at the single-cell level among undifferentiated spermatogonia from Postnatal Day 6 mouse testes, including Tspan8, Epha2, and Pvr, each of which encode cell surface proteins useful for cell selection. Transplantation studies provided definitive evidence that a {TSPAN8}-high subpopulation is enriched for {\SSCs}. {RNA}-seq analyses identified genes differentially expressed between {TSPAN8}-high and -low subpopulations that clustered into multiple biological pathways potentially involved in {\SSC} renewal or differentiation, respectively. Methyl-seq analysis identified hypomethylated domains in the promoters of these genes in both subpopulations that colocalized with peaks of histone modifications defined by {ChIP}-seq analysis. Taken together, these results demonstrate functional heterogeneity among mouse undifferentiated spermatogonia and point to key biological characteristics that distinguish {\SSCs} from progenitor spermatogonia. \copyright 2016 by the Society for the Study of Reproduction, Inc.}

In recent years, there has been a proliferation of {GSE} analysis methods and hence it has become increasingly difficult for researchers to select an optimal {GSE} tool based on their particular dataset. Moreover, the majority of {GSE} analysis methods do not allow researchers to simultaneously compare gene set level results between multiple experimental conditions. Results: The ensemble of genes set enrichment analyses ({EGSEA}) is a method developed for {RNA}-sequencing data that combines results from twelve algorithms and calculates collective gene set scores to improve the biological relevance of the highest ranked gene sets. {EGSEA}'s gene set database contains around 25 000 gene sets from sixteen collections. It has multiple visualization capabilities that allow researchers to view gene sets at various levels of granularity. {EGSEA} has been tested on simulated data and on a number of human and mouse datasets and, based on biologists' feedback, consistently outperforms the individual tools that have been combined. Our evaluation demonstrates the superiority of the ensemble approach for {GSE} analysis, and its utility to effectively and efficiently extrapolate biological functions and potential involvement in disease processes from lists of differentially regulated genes. Availability and Implementation: {EGSEA} is available as an R package at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/{EGSEA}/ .

Combining such large-scale biological data sets can lead to the discovery of important biological insights, provided that relevant information can be extracted in a holistic manner. Current statistical approaches have been focusing on identifying small subsets of molecules (a 'molecular signature') to explain or predict biological conditions, but mainly for a single type of 'omics. In addition, commonly used methods are univariate and consider each biological feature independently. We introduce {mixOmics}, an R package dedicated to the multivariate analysis of biological data sets with a specific focus on data exploration, dimension reduction and visualisation. By adopting a systems biology approach, the toolkit provides a wide range of methods that statistically integrate several data sets at once to probe relationships between heterogeneous 'omics data sets. Our recent methods extend Projection to Latent Structure ({PLS}) models for discriminant analysis, for data integration across multiple 'omics data or across independent studies, and for the identification of molecular signatures. We illustrate our latest {mixOmics} integrative frameworks for the multivariate analyses of 'omics data available from the package.}

Causes of infertility are numerous and the treatment often does not lead to desired pregnancy especially when there is a lack of functional gametes. In humans, the primordial germ cell ({PGC}) is the primary undifferentiated stem cell type that will differentiate towards gametes: spermatozoa or oocytes. With the development of stem cell biology and differentiation protocols, {PGC} can be obtained from pluripotent stem cells providing a new therapeutic possibility to treat infertile couples. Recent studies demonstrated that viable mouse pups could be obtained from in vitro differentiated stem cells suggesting that translation of these results to human is closer.

abstract = {Organisms can change their physiological/behavioural traits to adapt and survive in changed environments. However, whether these acquired traits can be inherited across generations through non-genetic alterations has been a topic of debate for over a century. Emerging evidence indicates that both ancestral and parental experiences, including nutrition, environmental toxins, nurturing behaviour, and social stress, can have powerful effects on the physiological, metabolic and cellular functions in an organism. In certain circumstances, these effects can be transmitted across several generations through epigenetic (i.e. non-{DNA} sequence-based rather than mutational) modifications. In this review, we summarize recent evidence on epigenetic inheritance from parental environment-induced developmental and physiological alterations in nematodes, fruit flies, zebrafish, rodents, and humans. The epigenetic modifications demonstrated to be both susceptible to modulation by environmental cues and heritable, including {DNA} methylation, histone modification, and small non-coding {RNAs}, are also summarized. We particularly focus on evidence that parental environment-induced epigenetic alterations are transmitted through both the maternal and paternal germlines and exert sex-specific effects. The thought-provoking data presented here raise fundamental questions about the mechanisms responsible for these phenomena. In particular, the means that define the specificity of the response to parental experience in the gamete epigenome and that direct the establishment of the specific epigenetic change in the developing embryos, as well as in specific tissues in the descendants, remain obscure and require elucidation. More precise epigenetic assessment at both the genome-wide level and single-cell resolution as well as strategies for breeding at relatively sensitive periods of development and manipulation aimed at specific epigenetic modification are imperative for identifying parental environment-induced epigenetic marks across generations. Considering their diverse epigenetic architectures, the conservation and prevalence of the mechanisms underlying epigenetic inheritance in non-mammals require further investigation in mammals. Interpretation of the consequences arising from epigenetic inheritance on organisms and a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms will provide insight into how gene-environment interactions shape developmental processes and physiological functions, which in turn may have wide-ranging implications for human health, and understanding biological adaptation and evolution. \copyright 2017 The Authors.

abstract = {Histones are the protein components of the nucleosome, which forms the basic architecture of eukaryotic chromatin. Histones {H2A}, {H2B}, H3, and H4 are composed of two common regions, the "histone fold" and the "histone tail". Many efforts have been focused on the mechanisms by which the post-translational modifications of histone tails regulate the higher-order chromatin architecture. On the other hand, previous biochemical studies have suggested that histone tails also affect the structure and stability of the nucleosome core particle itself. However, the precise contributions of each histone tail are unclear. In the present study, we determined the crystal structures of four mutant nucleosomes, in which one of the four histones, {H2A}, {H2B}, H3, or H4, lacked the N-terminal tail. We found that the deletion of the {H2B} or H3 N-terminal tail affected histone-{DNA} interactions and substantially decreased nucleosome stability. These findings provide important information for understanding the complex roles of histone tails in regulating chromatin structure.}

abstract = {To allow efficient transcript/gene detection, highly abundant ribosomal {RNAs} ({rRNA}) are generally removed from total {RNA} either by positive {polyA}+ selection or by {rRNA} depletion (negative selection) before sequencing. Comparisons between the two methods have been carried out by various groups, but the assessments have relied largely on non-clinical samples. In this study, we evaluated these two {RNA} sequencing approaches using human blood and colon tissue samples. Our analyses showed that {rRNA} depletion captured more unique transcriptome features, whereas {polyA}+ selection outperformed {rRNA} depletion with higher exonic coverage and better accuracy of gene quantification. For blood- and colon-derived {RNAs}, we found that 220\% and 50\% more reads, respectively, would have to be sequenced to achieve the same level of exonic coverage in the {rRNA} depletion method compared with the {polyA}+ selection method. Therefore, in most cases we strongly recommend {polyA}+ selection over {rRNA} depletion for gene quantification in clinical {RNA} sequencing. Our evaluation revealed that a small number of {lncRNAs} and small {RNAs} made up a large fraction of the reads in the {rRNA} depletion {RNA} sequencing data. Thus, we recommend that these {RNAs} are specifically depleted to improve the sequencing depth of the remaining {RNAs}.}

Epigenetics refers to heritable alterations in gene expression that are not mediated by changes in primary {DNA} sequence and includes mitotic and/or meiotic events. In essence, epigenetic modulation results in functional adaptations of the genomic response to the environment and is believed to play a fundamental role in early developmental plasticity.

The meanings span from Waddington's "epigenotype" and "epigenetic landscape" to the molecular biologists' "epigenetic marks" embodied by {DNA} methylation and histone modifications. Here we seek to quell the ambiguity of the name. First we place "epigenetic" in the various historical contexts. Then, by presenting the formal concepts of dynamical systems theory we show that the "epigenetic landscape" is more than a metaphor: it has specific mathematical foundations. The latter explains how gene regulatory networks produce multiple attractor states, the self-stabilizing patterns of gene activation across the genome that account for "epigenetic memory". This network dynamics approach replaces the reductionist correspondence of molecular epigenetic modifications with concept of the epigenetic landscape, by providing a concrete and crisp correspondence.}

We used a novel total {RNA} benchmarking dataset in which small non-coding {RNAs} are highly represented along with other long {RNAs}. The four {RNA}-seq pipelines consisted of two commonly-used alignment-free pipelines and two variants of alignment-based pipelines. We found that all pipelines showed high accuracy for quantifying the expression of long and highly-abundant genes. However, alignment-free pipelines showed systematically poorer performance in quantifying lowly-abundant and small {RNAs}. {CONCLUSION}: We have shown that alignment-free and traditional alignment-based quantification methods perform similarly for common gene targets, such as protein-coding genes.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Developmental programming of the embryo is controlled by genetic information but also dictated by epigenetic information contained in spermatozoa. Lifestyle and environmental factors not only influence health in one individual but can also affect the phenotype of the following generations. This is mediated via epigenetic inheritance i.e., gametic transmission of environmentally-driven epigenetic information to the offspring. Evidence is accumulating that preconceptional exposure to certain lifestyle and environmental factors, such as diet, physical activity, and smoking, affects the phenotype of the next generation through remodeling of the epigenetic blueprint of spermatozoa. {SCOPE} {OF} {REVIEW}: This review will summarize current knowledge about the different epigenetic signals in sperm that are responsive to environmental and lifestyle factors and are capable of affecting embryonic development and the phenotype of the offspring later in life. {MAJOR} {CONCLUSIONS}: Like somatic cells, the epigenome of spermatozoa has proven to be dynamically reactive to a wide variety of environmental and lifestyle stressors. The functional consequence on embryogenesis and phenotype of the next generation remains largely unknown. However, strong evidence of environmentally-driven sperm-borne epigenetic factors, which are capable of altering the phenotype of the next generation, is emerging on a large scale.

abstract = {3' untranslated regions (3' {UTRs}) of messenger {RNAs} ({mRNAs}) are best known to regulate {mRNA}-based processes, such as {mRNA} localization, {mRNA} stability, and translation. In addition, 3' {UTRs} can establish 3' {UTR}-mediated protein-protein interactions ({PPIs}), and thus can transmit genetic information encoded in 3' {UTRs} to proteins. This function has been shown to regulate diverse protein features, including protein complex formation or posttranslational modifications, but is also expected to alter protein conformations. Therefore, 3' {UTR}-mediated information transfer can regulate protein features that are not encoded in the amino acid sequence. This review summarizes both 3' {UTR} functions-the regulation of {mRNA} and protein-based processes-and highlights how each 3' {UTR} function was discovered with a focus on experimental approaches used and the concepts that were learned. This review also discusses novel approaches to study 3' {UTR} functions in the future by taking advantage of recent advances in technology.

abstract = {Motivation: Genome alignment of reads is the first step of most genome analysis workflows. In the case of {RNA}-Seq, transcriptome pseudoalignment of reads is a fast alternative to genome alignment, but the different coordinate systems of the genome and transcriptome have made it difficult to perform direct comparisons between the approaches. Results: We have developed tools for converting genome alignments to transcriptome pseudoalignments, and conversely, for projecting transcriptome pseudoalignments to genome alignments. Using these tools, we performed a direct comparison of genome alignment with transcriptome pseudoalignment. We find that both approaches produce similar quantifications. This means that for many applications genome alignment and transcriptome pseudoalignment are interchangeable. Availability and Implementation: bam2tcc is a C++14 software for converting alignments in {SAM}/{BAM} format to transcript compatibility counts ({TCCs}) and is available at https://github.com/pachterlab/bam2tcc. kallisto genomebam is a user option of kallisto that outputs a sorted {BAM} file in genome coordinates as part of transcriptome pseudoalignment.

At the Agouti viable yellow (Avy) locus, an endogenous retrovirus ({ERV}) of the intracisternal A particle ({IAP}) class retrotransposed upstream of the agouti coat-color locus, providing an alternative promoter that is variably {DNA} methylated in genetically identical individuals. This results in variable expressivity of coat color that is inherited transgenerationally. Here, a systematic genome-wide screen identifies multiple {C57BL}/{6J} murine {IAPs} with Avy epigenetic properties. Each exhibits a stable methylation state within an individual but varies between individuals. Only in rare instances do they act as promoters controlling adjacent gene expression. Their methylation state is locus-specific within an individual, and their flanking regions are enriched for {CTCF}. Variably methylated {IAPs} are reprogrammed after fertilization and re-established as variable loci in the next generation, indicating reconstruction of metastable epigenetic states and challenging the generalizability of non-genetic inheritance at these regions.

abstract = {In plants, transgenerational inheritance of some epialleles has been demonstrated but it remains controversial whether epigenetic variation is subject to selection and contributes to adaptation. Simulating selection in a rapidly changing environment, we compare phenotypic traits and epigenetic variation between Arabidopsis thaliana populations grown for five generations under selection and their genetically nearly identical ancestors. Selected populations of two distinct genotypes show significant differences in flowering time and plant architecture, which are maintained for at least 2-3 generations in the absence of selection. While we cannot detect consistent genetic changes, we observe a reduction of epigenetic diversity and changes in the methylation state of about 50,000 cytosines, some of which are associated with phenotypic changes. Thus, we propose that epigenetic variation is subject to selection and can contribute to rapid adaptive responses, although the extent to which epigenetics plays a role in adaptation is still unclear.}

abstract = {The development of germ cells is a highly ordered process that begins during fetal growth and is completed in the adult. Epigenetic modifications that occur in germ cells are important for germ cell function and for post-fertilization embryonic development. We have previously shown that male germ cells in the adult mouse have a highly distinct epigenetic state, as revealed by a unique genome-wide pattern of {DNA} methylation. Although it is known that these patterns begin to be established during fetal life, it is not known to what extent {DNA} methylation is modified during spermatogenesis. We have used restriction landmark genomic scanning ({RLGS}) and other techniques to examine {DNA} methylation at multiple sites across the genome during postnatal germ cell development in the mouse. Although a significant proportion of the distinct germ cell pattern is acquired prior to the type A spermatogonial stage, we find that both de novo methylation and demethylation occur during spermatogenesis, mainly in spermatogonia and spermatocytes in early meiotic prophase I. Alterations include predominantly non-{CpG} island sequences from both unique loci and repetitive elements. These modifications are progressive and are almost exclusively completed by the end of the pachytene spermatocyte stage. These studies better define the developmental timing of genome-wide {DNA} methylation pattern acquisition during male germ cell development.}

We show that Bisphenol A ({BPA}) exposure causes the derepression of an epigenomically silenced transgene in the germline for 5 generations, regardless of ancestral response. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing ({ChIP}-seq), histone modification quantitation, and immunofluorescence assays revealed that this effect is associated with a reduction of the repressive marks {H3K9me3} and {H3K27me3} in whole worms and in germline nuclei in the F3, as well as with reproductive dysfunctions, including germline apoptosis and embryonic lethality. Furthermore, targeting of the Jumonji demethylases {JMJD}-2 and {JMJD}-3/{UTX}-1 restores {H3K9me3} and {H3K27me3} levels, respectively, and it fully alleviates the {BPA}-induced transgenerational effects.

Data from different species continue show that sperm contain a complex suite of coding and noncoding {RNAs} that play a role in an individual's life course. Mature sperm {RNAs} provide a retrospective of spermatogenesis, with their presence and abundance reflecting sperm maturation, fertility potential, and the paternal contribution to the developmental path the offspring may follow.Sperm {RNAs} delivered upon fertilization provide some of the initial contacts with the oocyte, directly confront the maternal with the paternal contribution as a prelude to genome consolidation. Following syngamy, early embryo development may in part be modulated by paternal {RNAs} that can include epidydimal passengers. This provides a direct path to relay an experience and then initiate a paternal response to the environment to the oocyte and beyond. Their epigenetic impact is likely felt prior to embryonic genome activation when the population of sperm delivered transcripts markedly changes. Here, we review the insights gained from sperm {RNAs} over the years, the subtypes, and the caveats of the {RNAs} described. We discuss the role of sperm {RNAs} in fertilization and embryo development, and their possible mechanism(s) influencing offspring phenotype. Approaches to meet the future challenges as the study of sperm {RNAs} continues, include, elucidating the potential mechanisms underlying how paternal allostatic load, the constant adaptation of health to external conditions, may be relayed by sperm {RNAs} to affect future generations.}

To investigate the biological role(s) of histone H4 lysine 20 (H4 Lys-20) methylation, we created a novel panel of antibodies that specifically detected mono-, di-, or trimethylated H4 Lys-20. We report that the different methylated forms of H4 Lys-20 are compartmentalized within visually distinct, transcriptionally silent regions in the mammalian nucleus. Interestingly, direct comparison of methylated H4 Lys-20 with the different methylated states of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3 Lys-9) revealed significant overlap and exclusion between the specific groups of methyl modifications. Trimethylated H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 were both selectively enriched within pericentric heterochromatin. Similarly, monomethylated H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 partitioned together and the dimethylated forms partitioned together within the chromosome arms; however, the mono- and dimethylated modifications were virtually exclusive. These findings strongly suggest that the combinatorial presence or absence of the different methylated states of H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 define particular types of silent chromatin. Consistent with this, detailed analysis of monomethylated H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 revealed that both were preferentially and selectively enriched within the same nucleosome particle in vivo. Collectively, these findings define a novel trans-tail histone code involving monomethylated H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 that act cooperatively to mark distinct regions of silent chromatin within the mammalian epigenome.}

abstract = {{ATAC}-seq has been widely adopted to identify accessible chromatin regions across the genome. However, current data analysis still utilizes approaches initially designed for {ChIP}-seq or {DNase}-seq, without considering the transposase digested {DNA} fragments that contain additional nucleosome positioning information. We present the first dedicated {ATAC}-seq analysis tool, a semi-supervised machine learning approach named {HMMRATAC}. {HMMRATAC} splits a single {ATAC}-seq dataset into nucleosome-free and nucleosome-enriched signals, learns the unique chromatin structure around accessible regions, and then predicts accessible regions across the entire genome. We show that {HMMRATAC} outperforms the popular peak-calling algorithms on published human {ATAC}-seq datasets. We find that single-end sequenced or size-selected {ATAC}-seq datasets result in a loss of sensitivity compared to paired-end datasets without size-selection. \copyright The Author(s) 2019.

However, as next-generation sequencing technologies have developed, so too has {RNA}-seq. Now, {RNA}-seq methods are available for studying many different aspects of {RNA} biology, including single-cell gene expression, translation (the translatome) and {RNA} structure (the structurome). Exciting new applications are being explored, such as spatial transcriptomics (spatialomics). Together with new long-read and direct {RNA}-seq technologies and better computational tools for data analysis, innovations in {RNA}-seq are contributing to a fuller understanding of {RNA} biology, from questions such as when and where transcription occurs to the folding and intermolecular interactions that govern {RNA} function.}

Although genomic {DNA} contributes to the majority of the inheritance, it is now clear that epigenetic information -information beyond the underlying {DNA} sequence - is also passed on to future generations. However, the mechanism and extent of such inheritance are not well-understood. Here, I review some of the concepts, evidence, and mechanisms of intergenerational epigenetic inheritance via sperm small {RNAs}. Recent studies provide evidence that mature sperm are highly abundant in small non-coding {RNAs}. These {RNAs} are modulated by paternal environmental conditions and potentially delivered to the zygote at fertilization, where they can regulate early embryonic development. Intriguingly, sperm small {RNA} payload undergoes dramatic changes during testicular and post-testicular maturation, making the mature sperm epigenome highly unique and distinct from testicular germ cells. I explore the mechanism of sperm small {RNA} remodeling during post-testicular maturation in the epididymis, and the potential role of this reprograming in intergenerational epigenetic inheritance.

We apply {diffTF} to compare (1) mutated and unmutated chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients and (2) two hematopoietic progenitor cell types.

abstract = {Heterochromatic gene silencing is an important form of gene regulation that usually requires specific histone modifications. A popular model posits that inheritance of modified histones, especially in the form of H3-H4 tetramers, underlies inheritance of heterochromatin. Because H3-H4 tetramers are randomly distributed between daughter chromatids during {DNA} replication, rare occurrences of asymmetric tetramer inheritance within a heterochromatic domain would have the potential to destabilize heterochromatin. This model makes a prediction that shorter heterochromatic domains would experience unbalanced tetramer inheritance more frequently, and thereby be less stable. In contrast to this prediction, we found that shortening a heterochromatic domain in Saccharomyces had no impact on the strength of silencing nor its heritability. Additionally, we found that replisome mutations that disrupt inheritance of H3-H4 tetramers had only minor effects on heterochromatin stability. These findings suggest that histones carry little or no memory of the heterochromatin state through {DNA} replication. \copyright 2019, Saxton and Rine.}

While it is now clear that astrocytes are affected by {HD} and significantly contribute to neuronal dysfunction and pathogenesis, the alterations in the transcriptional and epigenetic profiles in {HD} astrocytes have yet to be characterized. Here, we examine global transcription and chromatin accessibility dynamics during in vitro astrocyte differentiation in a transgenic non-human primate model of {HD}. {RESULTS}: We found global changes in accessibility and transcription across different stages of {HD} pluripotent stem cell differentiation, with distinct trends first observed in neural progenitor cells ({NPCs}), once cells have committed to a neural lineage. Transcription of p53 signaling and cell cycle pathway genes was highly impacted during differentiation, with depletion in {HD} {NPCs} and upregulation in {HD} astrocytes. {E2F} target genes also displayed this inverse expression pattern, and strong associations between {E2F} target gene expression and accessibility at nearby putative enhancers were observed. {CONCLUSIONS}: The results suggest that chromatin accessibility and transcription are altered throughout in vitro {HD} astrocyte differentiation and provide evidence that {E2F} dysregulation contributes to aberrant cell-cycle re-entry and apoptosis throughout the progression from {NPCs} to astrocytes.}

abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms of human germ cell biology is important for developing infertility treatments. However, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate human gametogenesis due to the difficulties in collecting samples, especially germ cells during fetal development. In contrast to the mitotic arrest of spermatogonia stem cells in the fetal testis, female germ cells proceed into meiosis and began folliculogenesis in fetal ovaries. Regulations of these developmental events, including the initiation of meiosis and the endowment of primordial follicles, remain an enigma. Studying the molecular mechanisms of female germ cell biology in the human ovary has been mostly limited to spatiotemporal characterizations of genes or proteins. Recent efforts in utilizing in vitro differentiation system of stem cells to derive germ cells have allowed researchers to begin studying molecular mechanisms during human germ cell development. Meanwhile, the possibility of isolating female germline stem cells in adult ovaries also excites researchers and generates many debates. This review will mainly focus on presenting and discussing recent in vivo and in vitro studies on female germ cell biology in human. The topics will highlight the progress made in understanding the three main stages of germ cell developments: namely, primordial germ cell formation, meiotic initiation, and folliculogenesis.}

abstract = {{CONFOUNDING} {FACTORS}: In transcriptomics experimentation, confounding factors frequently exist alongside the intended experimental factors and can severely influence the outcome of a transcriptome analysis. Confounding factors are regularly discussed in methodological literature, but their actual, practical impact on the outcome and interpretation of transcriptomics experiments is, to our knowledge, not documented. For instance, in-vivo experimental factors; like Individual, Sample-Composition and Time-of-Day are potentially formidable confounding factors. To study these confounding factors, we designed an extensive in-vivo transcriptome experiment (n = 264) with {UVR} exposure of murine skin containing six consecutive samples from each individual mouse (n = 64). {ANALYSIS} {APPROACH}: Evaluation of the confounding factors: Sample-Composition, Time-of-Day, Handling-Stress, and Individual-Mouse resulted in the identification of many genes that were affected by them. These genes sometimes showed over 30-fold expression differences. The most prominent confounding factor was Sample-Composition caused by mouse-dependent skin composition differences, sampling variation and/or influx/efflux of mobile cells. Although we can only evaluate these effects for known cell type specifically expressed genes in our complex heterogeneous samples, it is clear that the observed variations also affect the cumulative expression levels of many other non-cell-type-specific genes. {ANOVA}: {ANOVA} analysis can only attempt to neutralize the effects of the well-defined confounding factors, such as Individual-Mouse, on the experimental factors {UV}-Dose and Recovery-Time. Also, by definition, {ANOVA} only yields reproducible gene-expression differences, but we found that these differences were very small compared to the fold changes induced by the confounding factors, questioning the biological relevance of these {ANOVA}-detected differences. Furthermore, it turned out that many of the differentially expressed genes found by {ANOVA} were also present in the gene clusters associated with the confounding factors. {CONCLUSION}: Hence our overall conclusion is that confounding factors have a major impact on the outcome of in-vivo transcriptomics experiments. Thus the set-up, analysis, and interpretation of such experiments should be approached with the utmost prudence.}

In other organisms, maintenance of silencing requires a feed-forward loop between {H3K9me3} and small {RNAs}. Here, we show that in C. elegans not only is {H3K9me3} unnecessary for inheritance, the modification's function depends on the identity of the {RNAi}-targeted gene. We found an asymmetry in the requirement for {H3K9me3} and the main worm {H3K9me3} methyltransferases, {SET}-25 and {SET}-32. Both methyltransferases promote heritable silencing of the foreign gene gfp, but are dispensable for silencing of the endogenous gene oma-1. Genome-wide examination of heritable endogenous small interfering {RNAs} (endo-{siRNAs}) revealed that endo-{siRNAs} that depend on {SET}-25 and {SET}-32 target newly acquired and highly {H3K9me3} marked genes. Thus, 'repressive' chromatin marks could be important specifically for heritable silencing of genes which are flagged as 'foreign', such as gfp.

Such effects are not limited to the first generation offspring but may be transmitted to a second or a number of subsequent generations, through non-genomic mechanisms. While the transmission of 'programmed' effects through the maternal line could occur as a consequence of multiple influences, for example, altered maternal physiology, the inheritance of effects through the male line is more difficult to explain and there is much interest in a potential role for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. In this review, we will discuss the mechanisms by which induced effects may be transmitted through the paternal lineage, with a particular focus on the role of epigenetic inheritance.

Because extracellular vesicles derive their cargo from the contents of the cells that produce them, they are attractive sources of biomarkers for a variety of diseases. Furthermore, studies demonstrating phenotypic effects of specific extracellular vesicle-associated cargo on target cells have stoked interest in extracellular vesicles as therapeutic vehicles. There is particularly strong evidence that the {RNA} cargo of extracellular vesicles can alter recipient cell gene expression and function. During the past decade, extracellular vesicles and their {RNA} cargo have become better defined, but many aspects of extracellular vesicle biology remain to be elucidated. These include selective cargo loading resulting in substantial differences between the composition of extracellular vesicles and source cells; heterogeneity in extracellular vesicle size and composition; and undefined mechanisms for the uptake of extracellular vesicles into recipient cells and the fates of their cargo. Further progress in unravelling the basic mechanisms of extracellular vesicle biogenesis, transport, and cargo delivery and function is needed for successful clinical implementation. This Review focuses on the current state of knowledge pertaining to packaging, transport and function of {RNAs} in extracellular vesicles and outlines the progress made thus far towards their clinical applications.}

abstract = {Parental-specific epigenetic modifications are imprinted on a subset of genes in the mammalian genome during germ cell maturation. However, the precise timing of their establishment remains to be determined. Methylation of {CpG} dinucleotides has been shown to be a part of the parental imprint. We have examined how the methylation pattern characteristic of the paternal allele in germ cells are established during human spermatogenesis. Two representative imprinted genes, H19 and {MEST}/{PEG1}, were studied. The experiments were performed using the bisulphite sequencing method on microdissected individual cells at different stages of male germ cell differentiation. We show that both genes are unmethylated in fetal spermatogonia, suggesting that all pre-existing methylation imprints are already erased by this stage. The {MEST}/{PEG1} gene remains unmethylated at all subsequent post-pubertal stages of spermatogenesis, including mature spermatozoa. The methylation of H19 typical of the paternal allele first appears in a subset of adult spermatogonia and then is maintained in spermatocytes, spermatids and mature spermatozoa. Our results suggest that the methylation imprint inherited from the parents is first erased in the male germ line at an early fetal stage. The paternal-specific imprint is re-established only later, during spermatogonial differentiation in the adult testis.}

Here we briefly examine the literature on transgenerational actions of endocrine disrupting chemicals ({EDCs}) on brain and behavior and their underlying epigenetic mechanisms including: {DNA} methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding {RNAs}. We stress that epigenetic modifications need to be examined in a synergistic manner, as they act together in situ on chromatin to change transcription. Next we highlight recent work from one of our laboratories ({VGC}). The data provide new evidence that the sperm genome is poised for transcription. In developing sperm, gene enhancers and promoters are accessible for transcription and these activating motifs are also found in preimplantation embryos. Thus, {DNA} modifications associated with transcription factors during fertilization, in primordial germ cells ({PGCs}), and/or during germ cell maturation may be passed to offspring. We discuss the implications of this model to {EDC} exposures and speculate on whether natural variation in hormone levels during fertilization and {PGC} migration may impart transgenerational effects on brain and behavior. Lastly we discuss how this mechanism could apply to neural sexual differentiation. Copyright \copyright 2020. Published by Elsevier Inc.}

As evidence for germline non-genetic inheritance of phenotypes and diseases continues to grow in model organisms, there are fewer reports of this phenomenon in humans, due to a variety of complications in evaluating this mechanism of inheritance in humans. This review summarizes the evidence for germline-based non-genetic inheritance in humans, as well as the significant challenges and important caveats that must be considered when evaluating this process in human populations. Most reports of this process evaluate the association of a lifetime exposure in ancestors with changes in {DNA} methylation or small {RNA} expression in germ cells, as well as the association between ancestral experiences and the inheritance of a phenotype in descendants, down to great-grandchildren in some cases. Collectively, these studies provide evidence that phenotypes can be inherited in a {DNA}-independent manner; the extent to which this process contributes to disease development, as well as the cellular and molecular regulation of this process, remain largely undefined.}

abstract = {Spermatozoa of virtually all species can spontaneously take up exogenous {DNA} or {RNA} molecules and internalize them into nuclei. In this article I review evidence for a key role of a reverse transcriptase ({RT}) activity, encoded by {LINE}-1 retrotransposons, in the fate of the internalized nucleic acid molecules and their implication in transgenerational inheritance. {LINE}-1-derived {RT}, present in sperm heads, can reverse-transcribe the internalized molecules in {cDNA} copies: exogenous {RNA} is reverse-transcribed in a one-step reaction, whereas {DNA} is first transcribed into {RNA} and subsequently reverse-transcribed. Both {RNA} and {cDNA} molecules can be delivered from sperm cells to oocytes at fertilization, further propagated throughout embryogenesis and inherited in a non-Mendelian fashion in tissues of adult animals. The reverse-transcribed sequences are extrachromosomal, low-abundance, and mosaic distributed in tissues of adult individuals, where they are variably expressed. These "retrogenes" are transcriptionally competent and induce novel phenotypic traits in animals. Growing evidence indicate that cancer tissues produce {DNA}- and {RNA}-containing exosomes. We recently found that these exosomes are released in the bloodstream and eventually taken up into epididymal spermatozoa, consistent with the emerging view that a transgenerational flow of extrachromosomal {RNA} connects soma to germline and, further, to next generation embryos. Spermatozoa play a crucial bridging role in this process: they act as collectors of somatic information and as delivering vectors to the next generation. On the whole, this phenomenon is compatible with a Lamarckian-type view and closely resembles Darwinian pangenesis.}

abstract = {{STUDY} {QUESTION}: Do paternal exposures to folic acid deficient ({FD}), and/or folic acid supplemented ({FS}) diets, throughout germ cell development adversely affect male germ cells and consequently offspring health outcomes? {SUMMARY} {ANSWER}: Male mice exposed over their lifetimes to both {FD} and {FS} diets showed decreased sperm counts and altered imprinted gene methylation with evidence of transmission of adverse effects to the offspring, including increased postnatal-preweaning mortality and variability in imprinted gene methylation. {WHAT} {IS} {KNOWN} {ALREADY}: There is increasing evidence that disruptions in male germ cell epigenetic reprogramming are associated with offspring abnormalities and intergenerational disease. The fetal period is the critical time of {DNA} methylation pattern acquisition for developing male germ cells and an adequate supply of methyl donors is required. In addition, {DNA} methylation patterns continue to be remodeled during postnatal spermatogenesis. Previous studies have shown that lifetime (prenatal and postnatal) folic acid deficiency can alter the sperm epigenome and increase the incidence of fetal morphological abnormalities. {STUDY} {DESIGN}, {SIZE}, {DURATION}: Female {BALB}/c mice (F0) were placed on one of four amino-acid defined diets for 4 weeks before pregnancy and throughout pregnancy and lactation: folic acid control (Ctrl; 2 mg/kg), 7-fold folic acid deficient ({7FD}; 0.3 mg/kg), 10-fold high {FS} ({10FS}, 20 mg/kg) or 20-fold high {FS} ({20FS}, 40 mg/kg) diets. F1 males were weaned to their respective prenatal diets to allow for diet exposure during all windows of germline epigenetic reprogramming: the erasure, re-establishment and maintenance phases. {PARTICIPANTS}/{MATERIALS}, {SETTINGS}, {METHODS}: F0 females were mated with chow-fed males to produce F1 litters whose germ cells were exposed to the diets throughout embryonic development. F1 males were subsequently mated with chow-fed female mice. Two F2 litters, unexposed to the experimental diets, were generated from each F1 male; one litter was collected at embryonic day (E)18.5 and one delivered and followed postnatally. {DNA} methylation at a global level and at the differentially methylated regions of imprinted genes (H19, Imprinted Maternally Expressed Transcript (Non-Protein Coding)-H19, Small Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Polypeptide N-Snrpn, {KCNQ1} Opposite Strand/Antisense Transcript 1 (Non-Protein Coding)-Kcnq1ot1, Paternally Expressed Gene 1-Peg1 and Paternally Expressed Gene 3-Peg3) was assessed by luminometric methylation analysis and bisulfite pyrosequencing, respectively, in F1 sperm, F2 E18.5 placenta and F2 E18.5 brain cortex. {MAIN} {RESULTS} {AND} {THE} {ROLE} {OF} {CHANCE}: F1 males exhibited lower sperm counts following lifetime exposure to both folic acid deficiency and the highest dose of folic acid supplementation ({20FS}), (both P \textless 0.05). Post-implantation losses were increased amongst F2 E18.5 day litters from {20FS} exposed F1 males (P \textless 0.05). F2 litters derived from both {7FD} and {20FS} exposed F1 males had significantly higher postnatal-preweaning pup death (both P \textless 0.05). Sperm from {10FS} exposed males had increased variance in methylation across imprinted gene H19, P \textless 0.05; increased variance at a few sites within H19 was also found for the {7FD} and {20FS} groups (P \textless 0.05). While the {20FS} diet resulted in inter-individual alterations in methylation across the imprinted genes Snrpn and Peg3 in F2 E18.5 placenta, ≥50\% of individual sites tested in Peg1 and/or Peg3 were affected in the {7FD} and {10FS} groups. Inter-individual alterations in Peg1 methylation were found in F2 E18.5 day {10FS} group brain cortex (P \textless 0.05). {LARGE} {SCALE} {DATA}: Not applicable. {LIMITATIONS} {REASONS} {FOR} {CAUTION}: The cause of the increase in postnatal-preweaning mortality was not investigated post-mortem. Further studies are required to understand the mechanisms underlying the adverse effects of folic acid deficiency and supplementation on developing male germ cells. Genome-wide {DNA} and histone methylome studies as well as gene expression studies are required to better understand the links between folic acid exposures, an altered germ cell epigenome and offspring outcomes. {WIDER} {IMPLICATIONS} {OF} {THE} {FINDINGS}: The findings of this study provide further support for paternally transmitted environmental effects. The results indicate that both folic acid deficiency and high dose supplementation can be detrimental to germ cell development and reproductive fitness, in part by altering {DNA} methylation in sperm. {STUDY} {FUNDING} {AND} {COMPETING} {INTERESTS}: This study was supported by a grant to J.M.T. from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research ({CIHR} \#89944).

Here, we developed a cell-based assay in which {EVs} containing luciferase- or fluorescent-protein tagged cytosolic cargoes are loaded on unlabeled acceptor cells. Results from dose-responses, kinetics, and temperature-block experiments suggest that {EV} uptake is a low yield process (\~1\% spontaneous rate at 1 h). Further characterization of this limited {EV} uptake, through fractionation of membranes and cytosol, revealed cytosolic release (\~30\% of the uptaken {EVs}) in acceptor cells. This release is inhibited by bafilomycin A1 and overexpression of {IFITM} proteins, which prevent virus entry and fusion. Our results show that {EV} content release requires endosomal acidification and suggest the involvement of membrane fusion.}

The integration of epigenetics and genetics is critical for all developmental biology systems at the cellular and organism level. The current review is focused on the role of epigenetics during gametogenesis for both the spermatogenesis system in the male and oogenesis system in the female. The developmental stages from the initial primordial germ cell through gametogenesis to the mature sperm and egg are presented.

Here we show that exposure of pregnant mouse F0 females during E7.5-E13.5 to bisphenol A results in obesity in the F2 progeny in the absence of additional exposure. This epiphenotype can be transmitted through the male and female germlines up to the F5 generation, decreases in F6, and disappears in F7. Analysis of chromatin changes in the sperm of the F1 generation reveals a widespread increase in chromatin accessibility at binding sites for {CTCF} and other transcription factors accompanied by alterations in {3D} organization. Comparison of the transmission of obesity between F2 and F5 and its disappearance in F7 with alterations in the binding of these transcription factors points to the activation of an enhancer in an intron of the Fto gene as the cause of transgenerational inheritance. Activation of the Fto enhancer results in a decrease of {m6A} in sperm {RNAs}, which may result in alterations of gene expression in the embryo after fertilization. Given the established involvement of {SNPs} in {FTO} in human obesity, the results suggest that both genetic and epigenetic alterations of the same gene can lead to the same phenotypic outcomes on human health.}

Although many reports have characterized the functions of such chromatin marks in isolation, recent genome-wide studies reveal surprisingly complex interactions between them. Here, we focus on the interplay between {DNAme} and methylation of specific lysine residues on the histone H3 tail. We describe the impact of genetic perturbation of the relevant methyltransferases in the mouse on the landscape of chromatin marks as well as the transcriptome. In addition, we discuss the specific neurodevelopmental growth syndromes and cancers resulting from pathogenic mutations in the human orthologues of these genes. Integrating these observations underscores the fundamental importance of crosstalk between {DNA} and histone H3 methylation in development and disease. \copyright 2021. Springer Nature Limited.}

The most widely used criterion to ensure the analysis reliability is the false discovery rate ({FDR}), which is primarily controlled based on p-values. However, obtaining valid p-values relies on either reasonable assumptions of data distribution or large numbers of replicates under both conditions.

abstract = {For the past 120 years, the Weismann barrier and associated germ plasm theory of heredity have been a doctrine that has impacted evolutionary biology and our concepts of inheritance through the germline. Although August Weismann in his 1872 book was correct that the sperm and egg were the only cells to transmit molecular information to the subsequent generation, the concept that somatic cells do not impact the germline (i.e., the Weismann barrier) is incorrect. However, the doctrine or dogma of the Weismann barrier still influences many scientific fields and topics. The discovery of epigenetics, and more recently environmentally induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of phenotypic variation and pathology, have had significant impacts on evolution theory and medicine today. Environmental epigenetics and the concept of epigenetic transgenerational inheritance refute aspects of the Weismann barrier and require a re-evaluation of both inheritance theory and evolution theory.}

abstract = {Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in animals has increasingly been reported in recent years. Controversies, however, surround this unconventional mode of heredity, especially in mammals, for several reasons. First, its existence itself has been questioned due to perceived insufficiency of available evidence. Second, it potentially implies transfer of hereditary information from soma to germline, against the established principle in biology. Third, it inherently requires survival of epigenetic memory across reprogramming, posing another fundamental challenge in biology. Fourth, evolutionary significance of epigenetic inheritance has also been under debate. This article pointwise addresses all these concerns on the basis of recent empirical, theoretical and conceptual advances. 1) Described here in detail are the key experimental findings demonstrating the occurrence of germline epigenetic inheritance in mammals. 2) Newly emerging evidence supporting soma to germline communication in transgenerational inheritance in mammals, and a role of exosome and extracellular {microRNA} in this transmission, is thoroughly discussed. 3) The plausibility of epigenetic information propagation across reprogramming is highlighted. 4) Analyses supporting evolutionary significance of epigenetic inheritance are briefly mentioned. Finally, an integrative model of 'evolutionary transgenerational systems biology' is proposed to provide a framework to guide future advancements in epigenetic inheritance.}

abstract = {The testis is a key male reproductive organ that produces gametes through the process of spermatogenesis. Testis morphologies and spermatogenesis evolve rapidly in mammals, presumably due to the evolutionary pressure on males to be reproductively successful. The rapid evolution of the testis was shown to be reflected at the molecular level based on bulk-tissue work, but the molecular evolution of individual spermatogenic cell types across mammalian lineages remains largely uncharacterized. Here we report evolutionary analyses of single-nucleus transcriptome data for testes from eleven species that cover the three major mammalian lineages (eutherians, marsupials, egg-laying monotremes) and birds (the evolutionary outgroup), and include seven key primates. Our analyses reveal that the rapid evolution of the testis is driven by accelerated fixation rates of gene expression changes, amino acid altering substitutions, and newly emerged genes in late spermatogenic stages - likely facilitated by reduced pleiotropic constraints, haploid selection, and a transcriptionally permissive chromatin environment. We identify temporal expression changes of individual genes across species, which may have contributed to the emergence of species-specific phenotypes, but also conserved expression programs underlying ancestral spermatogenic processes. Sex chromosome analyses show that genes predominantly expressed in spermatogonia (i.e., germ cells fueling spermatogenesis) and Sertoli cells (i.e., somatic supporting cells) independently accumulated on X chromosomes across mammals during evolution, presumably due to male-beneficial selective forces. Further work uncovered that the process of meiotic sex chromosome inactivation ({MSCI}) also occurs in monotremes and hence is common to the different mammalian sex chromosome systems, contrary to previous inferences. Thus, the general mechanism of meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin ({MSUC}), which underlies {MSCI}, represents an ancestral mammalian feature. Together, our study illuminates the cellular and molecular evolution of mammalian spermatogenesis and associated selective forces, and provides a resource for investigating the biology of the testis across mammals.}

abstract = {Transcriptionally active chromatin is marked by tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 ({H3K4me3}) located after first exons and around transcription start sites. This epigenetic mark is typically restricted to narrow regions at the 5`end of the gene body, though a small subset of genes have a broad {H3K4me3} domain which extensively covers the coding region. Although most studies focus on the {H3K4me3} mark, the broad {H3K4me3} domain is associated with a plethora of histone modifications (e.g., H3 acetylated at K27) and is therein termed broad epigenetic domain. Genes marked with the broad epigenetic domain are involved in cell identity and essential cell functions and have clinical potential as biomarkers for patient stratification. Reducing expression of genes with the broad epigenetic domain may increase the metastatic potential of cancer cells. Enhancers and super-enhancers interact with the broad epigenetic domain marked genes forming a hub of interactions involving nucleosome-depleted regions. Together, the regulatory elements coalesce with transcription factors, chromatin modifying/remodeling enzymes, coactivators, and the Mediator and/or Integrator complex into a transcription factory which may be analogous to a liquid-liquid phase-separated condensate. The broad epigenetic domain has a dynamic chromatin structure which supports frequent transcription bursts. In this review, we present the current knowledge of broad epigenetic domains.}

Dynamic changes in chromatin structure allow the transition of the chromatin on these specialized cells into an embryonic configuration capable of generating every cell type. Initially, this reprogramming activity is supported by oocyte-derived factors accumulated during oogenesis as proteins and {mRNAs}; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms that govern it remain poorly characterized. Trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 ({H3K27me3}) is a repressive epigenetic mark that changes dynamically during pre-implantation development in mice, bovine and pig embryos. Here we present data and hypotheses related to the potential mechanisms behind {H3K27me3} remodeling during early development. We postulate that the repressive {H3K27me3} mark is globally erased from the parental genomes in order to remove the gametic epigenetic program and to establish a pluripotent embryonic epigenome. We discuss information gathered in mice, pigs, and bovine, with the intent of providing a comparative analysis of the reprogramming of this epigenetic mark during early mammalian development.}

These stimuli affect gene expression through intricate mechanisms of regulation that largely implicate epigenetic factors, such as, {DNA} methylation, histone post-translational modifications, and non-coding {RNAs} ({ncRNAs}). Through these molecular pathways, some of the behavioral phenotypes associated with life experiences can be stably transmitted to descendants, sometimes across several generations. Rodent studies indicate that parental stressful and traumatic experiences can lead to behavioral despair, risk-taking behaviors, altered sociability and atypical responses to stressful stimuli in the offspring, whereas parental environmental enrichment has been associated with improved cognition and stress resilience in the offspring. Similar observations have been made in humans; children and grandchildren of genocide survivors show increased psychopathology and emotional disturbances. At the molecular level, changes in germline {ncRNAs} have been identified as likely vectors of transmission in rodents. The mechanisms linking behavioral stimuli to the germline, and factors responsible for these changes and their persistence across generations remain, however, largely unidentified.}

This epididymis is a single, long convoluted tubule that links the testis to the vas deferens (1). During this transit, the male gametes acquire their fertilizing ability and their forward motility properties. Collectively, these modifications known as sperm maturation depend on a series of well-orchestrated biochemical modifications imposed upon the transiting male gamete (2). These modifications are in part regulated by extracellular microvesicles called epididymosomes that are found in the intraluminal epididymal compartment (3, 4). In this review, the biochemical composition of epididymosomes, their mode of secretion, the mechanisms underlying their interactions with the male gamete, and how they are involved in sperm maturation will be described.}

Either maternal grandparent can initiate this phenomenon, which persists for at least four wildtype generations. Here, we use genome-wide approaches to reveal genetic stability in the Mtrr model and genome-wide differential {DNA} methylation in the germline of Mtrr mutant maternal grandfathers. We observe that, while epigenetic reprogramming occurs, wildtype grandprogeny and great grandprogeny exhibit transcriptional changes that correlate with germline methylation defects. One region encompasses the Hira gene, which is misexpressed in embryos for at least three wildtype generations in a manner that distinguishes Hira transcript expression as a biomarker of maternal phenotypic inheritance.}

abstract = {Increasing evidence indicates that non-{DNA} sequence-based epigenetic information can be inherited across several generations in organisms ranging from yeast to plants to humans. This raises the possibility of heritable 'epimutations' contributing to heritable phenotypic variation and thus to evolution. Recent work has shed light on both the signals that underpin these epimutations, including {DNA} methylation, histone modifications and non-coding {RNAs}, and the mechanisms by which they are transmitted across generations at the molecular level. These mechanisms can vary greatly among species and have a more limited effect in mammals than in plants and other animal species. Nevertheless, common principles are emerging, with transmission occurring either via direct replicative mechanisms or indirect reconstruction of the signal in subsequent generations. As these processes become clearer we continue to improve our understanding of the distinctive features and relative contribution of {DNA} sequence and epigenetic variation to heritable differences in phenotype. \copyright 2022.

abstract = {Rapidly after gamete fusion, the sperm nucleus loses its specific chromatin conformation and the {DNA} is repopulated with maternally derived nucleosomes. We evaluated the nature of paternally derived nucleosomes and the dynamics of sperm chromatin remodeling in the zygote directly after gamete fusion. We observed histone H4 acetylated at K8 or K12 already prior to full decondensation of the sperm nucleus, suggesting that these marks are transmitted by the spermatozoon. Tracking down the origin of {H4K8ac} and {H4K12ac} during spermiogenesis revealed the retention of nucleosomes with these modifications in the chromocenter of elongating spermatids. We show that sperm constitutive heterochromatin is enriched for nucleosomes carrying specific histone modifications which are transmitted to the zygote. Our results suggest an epigenetic mechanism for inheritance of chromosomal architecture. Furthermore, up to pronucleus formation, histone acetylation and phosphorylation build up in a cascade-like fashion in the paternal chromatin. After formation of the pronucleus, a subset of these marks is removed from the heterochromatin, which suggests a reestablishment of the euchromatin-heterochromatin partition.}

abstract = {A diversity of gene regulatory mechanisms drives the changes in gene expression required for animal development. Here, we discuss the developmental roles of a class of gene regulatory factors composed of a core protein subunit of the Argonaute family and a 21-26-nucleotide {RNA} cofactor. These represent ancient regulatory complexes, originally evolved to repress genomic parasites such as transposons, viruses and retroviruses. However, over the course of evolution, small {RNA}-guided pathways have expanded and diversified, and they play multiple roles across all eukaryotes. Pertinent to this review, Argonaute and small {RNA}-mediated regulation has acquired numerous functions that affect all aspects of animal life. The regulatory function is provided by the Argonaute protein and its interactors, while the small {RNA} provides target specificity, guiding the Argonaute to a complementary {RNA}. C. elegans has 19 different, functional Argonautes, defining distinct yet interconnected pathways. Each Argonaute binds a relatively well-defined class of small {RNA} with distinct molecular properties. A broad classification of animal small {RNA} pathways distinguishes between two groups: (i) the {microRNA} pathway is involved in repressing relatively specific endogenous genes and (ii) the other small {RNA} pathways, which effectively act as a genomic immune system to primarily repress expression of foreign or "non-self" {RNA} while maintaining correct endogenous gene expression. {microRNAs} play prominent direct roles in all developmental stages, adult physiology and lifespan. The other small {RNA} pathways act primarily in the germline, but their impact extends far beyond, into embryogenesis and adult physiology, and even to subsequent generations. Here, we review the mechanisms and developmental functions of the diverse small {RNA} pathways of C. elegans. Copyright \copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}
