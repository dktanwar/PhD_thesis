abstract = {We describe a large-scale random approach termed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing ({RRBS}) for analyzing and comparing genomic methylation patterns. {BglII} restriction fragments were size-selected to 500-600 bp, equipped with adapters, treated with bisulfite, {PCR} amplified, cloned and sequenced. We constructed {RRBS} libraries from murine {ES} cells and from {ES} cells lacking {DNA} methyltransferases Dnmt3a and 3b and with knocked-down (kd) levels of Dnmt1 (Dnmt[1(kd),3a-/-,3b-/-]). Sequencing of 960 {RRBS} clones from Dnmt[1(kd),3a-/-,3b-/-] cells generated 343 kb of non-redundant bisulfite sequence covering 66212 cytosines in the genome. All but 38 cytosines had been converted to uracil indicating a conversion rate of \textgreater99.9\%. Of the remaining cytosines 35 were found in {CpG} and 3 in {CpT} dinucleotides. Non-{CpG} methylation was \textgreater250-fold reduced compared with wild-type {ES} cells, consistent with a role for Dnmt3a and/or Dnmt3b in {CpA} and {CpT} methylation. Closer inspection revealed neither a consensus sequence around the methylated sites nor evidence for clustering of residual methylation in the genome. Our findings indicate random loss rather than specific maintenance of methylation in Dnmt[1(kd),3a-/-,3b-/-] cells. Near-complete bisulfite conversion and largely unbiased representation of {RRBS} libraries suggest that random shotgun bisulfite sequencing can be scaled to a genome-wide approach.}

abstract = {{DNase} I hypersensitive sites ({DHSs}) are markers of regulatory {DNA} and have underpinned the discovery of all classes of cis-regulatory elements including enhancers, promoters, insulators, silencers and locus control regions. Here we present the first extensive map of human {DHSs} identified through genome-wide profiling in 125 diverse cell and tissue types. We identify ∼2.9 million {DHSs} that encompass virtually all known experimentally validated cis-regulatory sequences and expose a vast trove of novel elements, most with highly cell-selective regulation. Annotating these elements using {ENCODE} data reveals novel relationships between chromatin accessibility, transcription, {DNA} methylation and regulatory factor occupancy patterns. We connect ∼580,000 distal {DHSs} with their target promoters, revealing systematic pairing of different classes of distal {DHSs} and specific promoter types. Patterning of chromatin accessibility at many regulatory regions is organized with dozens to hundreds of co-activated elements, and the transcellular {DNase} I sensitivity pattern at a given region can predict cell-type-specific functional behaviours. The {DHS} landscape shows signatures of recent functional evolutionary constraint. However, the {DHS} compartment in pluripotent and immortalized cells exhibits higher mutation rates than that in highly differentiated cells, exposing an unexpected link between chromatin accessibility, proliferative potential and patterns of human variation.}

Since the first public release of this annotation data set, few new protein-coding loci have been added, yet the number of alternative splicing transcripts annotated has steadily increased. The {GENCODE} 7 release contains 20,687 protein-coding and 9640 long noncoding {RNA} loci and has 33,977 coding transcripts not represented in {UCSC} genes and {RefSeq}. It also has the most comprehensive annotation of long noncoding {RNA} ({lncRNA}) loci publicly available with the predominant transcript form consisting of two exons. We have examined the completeness of the transcript annotation and found that 35\% of transcriptional start sites are supported by {CAGE} clusters and 62\% of protein-coding genes have annotated {polyA} sites. Over one-third of {GENCODE} protein-coding genes are supported by peptide hits derived from mass spectrometry spectra submitted to Peptide Atlas. New models derived from the Illumina Body Map 2.0 {RNA}-seq data identify 3689 new loci not currently in {GENCODE}, of which 3127 consist of two exon models indicating that they are possibly unannotated long noncoding loci. {GENCODE} 7 is publicly available from gencodegenes.org and via the Ensembl and {UCSC} Genome Browsers.}

Their presence on histones can dictate the higher-order chromatin structure in which {DNA} is packaged and can orchestrate the ordered recruitment of enzyme complexes to manipulate {DNA}. In this way, histone modifications have the potential to influence many fundamental biological processes, some of which may be epigenetically inherited.}

abstract = {Complex patterns of histone lysine methylation encode distinct functions within chromatin. We previously reported that trimethylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 ({H3K9}) occurs at both silent heterochromatin and at the transcribed regions of active mammalian genes, suggesting that the extent of histone lysine methylation involved in mammalian gene activation is not completely defined. To identify additional sites of histone methylation that respond to mammalian gene activity, we describe here a comparative assessment of all six known positions of histone lysine methylation and relate them to gene transcription. Using several model loci, we observed high trimethylation of {H3K4}, {H3K9}, {H3K36}, and {H3K79} in the transcribed region, consistent with previous findings. We identify {H4K20} monomethylation, a modification previously linked with repression, as a mark of transcription elongation in mammalian cells. In contrast, {H3K27} monomethylation, a modification enriched at pericentromeric heterochromatin, was observed broadly distributed throughout all euchromatic sites analyzed, with selective depletion in the vicinity of the transcription start sites at active genes. Together, these results underscore that similar to other described methyl-lysine modifications, {H4K20} and {H3K27} monomethylation are versatile and dynamic with respect to gene activity, suggesting the existence of novel site-specific methyltransferases and demethylases coupled to the transcription cycle.}

We demonstrate how {GSEA} yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, {GSEA} reveals many biological pathways in common. The {GSEA} method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.}

Knowing their properties, regulatory activity and targets is crucial to understand the regulation of differentiation and homeostasis. Here we use the {FANTOM5} panel of samples, covering the majority of human tissues and cell types, to produce an atlas of active, in vivo-transcribed enhancers. We show that enhancers share properties with {CpG}-poor messenger {RNA} promoters but produce bidirectional, exosome-sensitive, relatively short unspliced {RNAs}, the generation of which is strongly related to enhancer activity. The atlas is used to compare regulatory programs between different cells at unprecedented depth, to identify disease-associated regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms, and to classify cell-type-specific and ubiquitous enhancers. We further explore the utility of enhancer redundancy, which explains gene expression strength rather than expression patterns. The online {FANTOM5} enhancer atlas represents a unique resource for studies on cell-type-specific enhancers and gene regulation.}

abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: A gene set test is a differential expression analysis in which a P-value is assigned to a set of genes as a unit. Gene set tests are valuable for increasing statistical power, organizing and interpreting results and for relating expression patterns across different experiments. Existing methods are based on permutation. Methods that rely on permutation of probes unrealistically assume independence of genes, while those that rely on permutation of sample are suitable only for two-group comparisons with a good number of replicates in each group. {RESULTS}: We present {ROAST}, a statistically rigorous gene set test that allows for gene-wise correlation while being applicable to almost any experimental design. Instead of permutation, {ROAST} uses rotation, a Monte Carlo technology for multivariate regression. Since the number of rotations does not depend on sample size, {ROAST} gives useful results even for experiments with minimal replication. {ROAST} allows for any experimental design that can be expressed as a linear model, and can also incorporate array weights and correlated samples. {ROAST} can be tuned for situations in which only a subset of the genes in the set are actively involved in the molecular pathway. {ROAST} can test for uni- or bi-direction regulation. Probes can also be weighted to allow for prior importance. The power and size of the {ROAST} procedure is demonstrated in a simulation study, and compared to that of a representative permutation method. Finally, {ROAST} is used to test the degree of transcriptional conservation between human and mouse mammary stems. {AVAILABILITY}: {ROAST} is implemented as a function in the Bioconductor package limma available from www.bioconductor.org.}

Owing to the tremendous progress in next-generation sequencing technology, {ChIP}-seq offers higher resolution, less noise and greater coverage than its array-based predecessor {ChIP}-chip. With the decreasing cost of sequencing, {ChIP}-seq has become an indispensable tool for studying gene regulation and epigenetic mechanisms. In this Review, I describe the benefits and challenges in harnessing this technique with an emphasis on issues related to experimental design and data analysis. {ChIP}-seq experiments generate large quantities of data, and effective computational analysis will be crucial for uncovering biological mechanisms.}

abstract = {It is more evident now than ever that nucleosomes can transmit epigenetic information from one cell generation to the next. It has been demonstrated during the past decade that the posttranslational modifications of histone proteins within the chromosome impact chromatin structure, gene transcription, and epigenetic information. Multiple modifications decorate each histone tail within the nucleosome, including some amino acids that can be modified in several different ways. Covalent modifications of histone tails known thus far include acetylation, phosphorylation, sumoylation, ubiquitination, and methylation. A large body of experimental evidence compiled during the past several years has demonstrated the impact of histone acetylation on transcriptional control. Although histone modification by methylation and ubiquitination was discovered long ago, it was only recently that functional roles for these modifications in transcriptional regulation began to surface. Highlighted in this review are the recent biochemical, molecular, cellular, and physiological functions of histone methylation and ubiquitination involved in the regulation of gene expression as determined by a combination of enzymological, structural, and genetic methodologies.}

Chromatin modifications are major carriers of epigenetic information that both reflect and affect the transcriptional states of underlying genes. Several histone modifications are key players that are responsible for classical epigenetic phenomena. However, the mechanisms by which cells pass their histone modifications to daughter cells through mitotic division remain to be unveiled. Here, we review recent progress in the field and conclude that epigenetic modifications are not precisely maintained at a near-mononucleosome level of precision. We also suggest that transcription repression may be maintained by a buffer system that can tolerate a certain degree of fluctuation in repressive histone modification levels. This buffer system protects the repressed genes from potential improper derepression triggered by chromatin modification-level fluctuation resulting from cellular events, such as the cell-cycle-dependent dilution of the chromatin modifications and local responses to environmental cues.}

abstract = {Transcription factors are adaptor molecules that detect regulatory sequences in the {DNA} and target the assembly of protein complexes that control gene expression. Yet much of the {DNA} in the eukaryotic cell is in nucleosomes and thereby occluded by histones, and can be further occluded by higher-order chromatin structures and repressor complexes. Indeed, genome-wide location analyses have revealed that, for all transcription factors tested, the vast majority of potential {DNA}-binding sites are unoccupied, demonstrating the inaccessibility of most of the nuclear {DNA}. This raises the question of how target sites at silent genes become bound de novo by transcription factors, thereby initiating regulatory events in chromatin. Binding cooperativity can be sufficient for many kinds of factors to simultaneously engage a target site in chromatin and activate gene expression. However, in cases in which the binding of a series of factors is sequential in time and thus not initially cooperative, special "pioneer transcription factors" can be the first to engage target sites in chromatin. Such initial binding can passively enhance transcription by reducing the number of additional factors that are needed to bind the {DNA}, culminating in activation. In addition, pioneer factor binding can actively open up the local chromatin and directly make it competent for other factors to bind. Passive and active roles for the pioneer factor {FoxA} occur in embryonic development, steroid hormone induction, and human cancers. Herein we review the field and describe how pioneer factors may enable cellular reprogramming.}

We show that use of some filter/test statistics pairs presented in the literature may, however, lead to loss of type I error control. We describe other pairs which avoid this problem. In an application to microarray data, we found that gene-by-gene filtering by overall variance followed by a t-test increased the number of discoveries by 50\%. We also show that this particular statistic pair induces a lower bound on fold-change among the set of discoveries.

We report a genomic sequencing method that provides positive identification of 5-methylcytosine residues and yields strand-specific sequences of individual molecules in genomic {DNA}. The method utilizes bisulfite-induced modification of genomic {DNA}, under conditions whereby cytosine is converted to uracil, but 5-methylcytosine remains nonreactive. The sequence under investigation is then amplified by {PCR} with two sets of strand-specific primers to yield a pair of fragments, one from each strand, in which all uracil and thymine residues have been amplified as thymine and only 5-methylcytosine residues have been amplified as cytosine. The {PCR} products can be sequenced directly to provide a strand-specific average sequence for the population of molecules or can be cloned and sequenced to provide methylation maps of single {DNA} molecules. We tested the method by defining the methylation status within single {DNA} strands of two closely spaced {CpG} dinucleotides in the promoter of the human kininogen gene. During the analysis, we encountered in sperm {DNA} an unusual methylation pattern, which suggests that the high methylation level of single-copy sequences in sperm may be locally modulated by binding of protein factors in germ-line cells.}

abstract = {{DNA} methylation is a major epigenetic modification of the genome that regulates crucial aspects of its function. Genomic methylation patterns in somatic differentiated cells are generally stable and heritable. However, in mammals there are at least two developmental periods-in germ cells and in preimplantation embryos-in which methylation patterns are reprogrammed genome wide, generating cells with a broad developmental potential. Epigenetic reprogramming in germ cells is critical for imprinting; reprogramming in early embryos also affects imprinting. Reprogramming is likely to have a crucial role in establishing nuclear totipotency in normal development and in cloned animals, and in the erasure of acquired epigenetic information. A role of reprogramming in stem cell differentiation is also envisaged. {DNA} methylation is one of the best-studied epigenetic modifications of {DNA} in all unicellular and multicellular organisms. In mammals and other vertebrates, methylation occurs predominantly at the symmetrical dinucleotide {CpG} (1-4). Symmetrical methylation and the discovery of a {DNA} methyltransferase that prefers a hemimethylated substrate, Dnmt1 (4), suggested a mechanism by which specific patterns of methylation in the genome could be maintained. Patterns imposed on the genome at defined developmental time points in precursor cells could be maintained by Dnmt1, and would lead to predetermined programs of gene expression during development in descendants of the precursor cells (5, 6). This provided a means to explain how patterns of differentiation could be maintained by populations of cells. In addition, specific demethylation events in differentiated tissues could then lead to further changes in gene expression as needed. Neat and convincing as this model is, it is still largely unsubstantiated. While effects of methylation on expression of specific genes, particularly imprinted ones (7) and some retrotransposons (8), have been demonstrated in vivo, it is still unclear whether or not methylation is involved in the control of gene expression during normal development (9-13). Although enzymes have been identified that can methylate {DNA} de novo (Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b) (14), it is unknown how specific patterns of methylation are established in the genome. Mechanisms for active demethylation have been suggested, but no enzymes have been identified that carry out this function in vivo (15-17). Genomewide alterations in methylation-brought about, for example, by knockouts of the methylase genes-result in embryo lethality or developmental defects, but the basis for abnormal development still remains to be discovered (7, 14). What is clear, however, is that in mammals there are developmental periods of genomewide reprogramming of methylation patterns in vivo. Typically, a substantial part of the genome is demethylated, and after some time remethylated, in a cell- or tissue-specific pattern. The developmental dynamics of these reprogramming events, as well as some of the enzymatic mechanisms involved and the biological purposes, are beginning to be understood. Here we look at what is known about reprogramming in mammals and discuss how it might relate to developmental potency and imprinting.}

Residual nucleosomes are largely composed of the histone H3.3 variant and are trimethylated at Lys4 of histone H3 ({H3K4me3}). Canonical H3.1 and H3.2 histones are also enriched at {CpG}-rich promoters marked by Polycomb-mediated {H3K27me3}, a modification predictive of gene repression in preimplantation embryos. Histone variant-specific nucleosome retention in sperm is strongly associated with nucleosome turnover in round spermatids.

Noncoding {DNA}, containing introns, repetitive elements, and potentially active transposable elements, requires effective mechanisms for its long-term silencing. Mammals appear to have taken advantage of the possibilities afforded by cytosine methylation to provide a heritable mechanism for altering {DNA}-protein interactions to assist in such silencing. Genes can be transcribed from methylation-free promoters even though adjacent transcribed and nontranscribed regions are extensively methylated. Gene promoters can be used and regulated while keeping noncoding {DNA}, including transposable elements, suppressed. Methylation is also used for long-term epigenetic silencing of X-linked and imprinted genes and can either increase or decrease the level of transcription, depending on whether the methylation inactivates a positive or negative regulatory element.}

abstract = {Epigenetics provides a means of understanding how environmental factors might alter heritable changes in gene expression without changing {DNA} sequence, and hence the origin, of some diseases that are not explained by conventional genetic mechanisms. Various animal models have been described, most notably the agouti viable yellow (A(vy)) and axin 1 fused (Axin1(Fu)) mice, which lend themselves particularly well to studying this link between epigenetics and development abnormalities, because particular changes in {DNA} methylation patterns can be linked to a broad spectrum of heritable pathologies in the mice. In addition, there are specific examples, both in mice and other animal species, where nonmutagenic, environmental insults to either parent, such as those caused by consumption of endocrine-disrupting chemicals, can cause unexpected transgenerational phenotypic changes in offspring. Animals derived by somatic cell nuclear transfer also frequently exhibit pathologies that can be linked to inappropriate nuclear reprogramming during early embryo development and provide another means to study a link between epigenetics and disease. This review will consider how all of these animal models might help elucidate the epigenetic basis for a wide range of phenotypes.}

Vesicles of sizes ranging from 30 to 1000nm, or even larger, are generated by blebbing of the plasma membrane (microvesicles) or formed in multivesicular endosomes ({MVEs}) to be secreted by exocytosis as exosomes. Exosomes, microvesicles and other {EVs} contain membrane and cytosolic components that include proteins, lipids and {RNAs}, a composition that differs related to their site of biogenesis. Several mechanisms are involved in vesicle formation at the plasma membrane or in endosomes, which is reflected in their heterogeneity, size and composition. {EVs} have significant promise for therapeutics and diagnostics and for understanding physiological and pathological processes all of which have boosted research to find modulators of their composition, secretion and targeting.

Here, we examine piwi-interacting {RNAs} ({piRNAs}) associated with each Drosophila Piwi protein and find that Piwi and Aubergine bind {RNAs} that are predominantly antisense to transposons, whereas Ago3 complexes contain predominantly sense {piRNAs}. As in mammals, the majority of Drosophila {piRNAs} are derived from discrete genomic loci. These loci comprise mainly defective transposon sequences, and some have previously been identified as master regulators of transposon activity. Our data suggest that heterochromatic {piRNA} loci interact with potentially active, euchromatic transposons to form an adaptive system for transposon control. Complementary relationships between sense and antisense {piRNA} populations suggest an amplification loop wherein each {piRNA}-directed cleavage event generates the 5' end of a new {piRNA}. Thus, sense {piRNAs}, formed following cleavage of transposon {mRNAs} may enhance production of antisense {piRNAs}, complementary to active elements, by directing cleavage of transcripts from master control loci.}

abstract = {The germline represents a unique cell type that can transmit genetic material to the next generation. During early embryonic development, somatic cells give rise to a small population of cells known as germ cells, which eventually differentiate into mature gametes. Germ cells undergo a process of removing and resetting relevant epigenetic information, mainly by {DNA} demethylation. This extensive epigenetic reprogramming leads to the conversion of germ cells into immortal cells that can pass on the genome to the next generation. In the absence of germline-specific reprogramming, germ cells would preserve the old, parental epigenetic memory, which would prevent the transfer of heritable information to the offspring. On the contrary, somatic cells cannot reset epigenetic information by preserving the full methylation pattern on imprinting genes. In this review, we focus on the capacity of germ cells and somatic cells (soma) to transfer genetic information to the next generation, and thus revisit the Weismann theory of heredity.

Definition of the oocyte {DNA} methylome by whole genome approaches revealed that the majority of methylated {CpG} islands are intragenic and gene bodies are hypermethylated. Yet, the mechanisms by which transcription regulates {DNA} methylation in oocytes remain unclear. Here, we systematically test the link between transcription and the methylome. {RESULTS}: We perform deep {RNA}-Seq and de novo transcriptome assembly at different stages of mouse oogenesis. This reveals thousands of novel non-annotated genes, as well as alternative promoters, for approximately 10 \% of reference genes expressed in oocytes. In addition, a large fraction of novel promoters coincide with {MaLR} and {ERVK} transposable elements. Integration with our transcriptome assembly reveals that transcription correlates accurately with {DNA} methylation and accounts for approximately 85-90 \% of the methylome. We generate a mouse model in which transcription across the Zac1/Plagl1 locus is abrogated in oocytes, resulting in failure of {DNA} methylation establishment at all {CpGs} of this locus. {ChIP} analysis in oocytes reveals {H3K4me2} enrichment at the Zac1 imprinted control region when transcription is ablated, establishing a connection between transcription and chromatin remodeling at {CpG} islands by histone demethylases. {CONCLUSIONS}: By precisely defining the mouse oocyte transcriptome, this work not only highlights transcription as a cornerstone of {DNA} methylation establishment in female germ cells, but also provides an important resource for developmental biology research.}

Existing gene set tests that rely on gene permutation are shown here to be extremely sensitive to inter-gene correlation. Several data sets are analyzed to show that inter-gene correlation is non-ignorable even for experiments on homogeneous cell populations using genetically identical model organisms. A new gene set test procedure ({CAMERA}) is proposed based on the idea of estimating the inter-gene correlation from the data, and using it to adjust the gene set test statistic. An efficient procedure is developed for estimating the inter-gene correlation and characterizing its precision. {CAMERA} is shown to control the type I error rate correctly regardless of inter-gene correlations, yet retains excellent power for detecting genuine differential expression. Analysis of breast cancer data shows that {CAMERA} recovers known relationships between tumor subtypes in very convincing terms. {CAMERA} can be used to analyze specified sets or as a pathway analysis tool using a database of molecular signatures.}

The quality and interpretability of the {RGCCA} components are likely to be affected by the usefulness and relevance of the variables in each block. Therefore, it is an important issue to identify within each block which subsets of significant variables are active in the relationships between blocks. In this paper, {RGCCA} is extended to address the issue of variable selection. Specifically, sparse generalized canonical correlation analysis ({SGCCA}) is proposed to combine {RGCCA} with an [Formula: see text]-penalty in a unified framework. Within this framework, blocks are not necessarily fully connected, which makes {SGCCA} a flexible method for analyzing a wide variety of practical problems. Finally, the versatility and usefulness of {SGCCA} are illustrated on a simulated dataset and on a 3-block dataset which combine gene expression, comparative genomic hybridization, and a qualitative phenotype measured on a set of 53 children with glioma. {SGCCA} is available on {CRAN} as part of the {RGCCA} package. \copyright The Author 2014.

abstract = {Inheritance is typically associated with the Mendelian transmission of information from parents to offspring by alleles ({DNA} sequence). However, empirical data clearly suggest that traits can be acquired from ancestors by mechanisms that do not involve genetic alleles, referred to as non-genetic inheritance. Information that is non-genetically transmitted across generations includes parental experience and exposure to certain environments, but also parental mutations and polymorphisms, because they can change the parental 'intrinsic' environment. Non-genetic inheritance is not limited to the first generation of the progeny, but can involve the grandchildren and even further generations. Non-genetic inheritance has been observed for multiple traits including overall development, cardiovascular risk and metabolic symptoms, but this review will focus on the inheritance of behavioral abnormalities pertinent to psychiatric disorders. Multigenerational non-genetic inheritance is often interpreted as the transmission of epigenetic marks, such as {DNA} methylation and chromatin modifications, via the gametes (transgenerational epigenetic inheritance). However, information can be carried across generations by a large number of bioactive substances, including hormones, cytokines, and even microorganisms, without the involvement of the gametes. We reason that this broader definition of non-genetic inheritance is more appropriate, especially in the context of psychiatric disorders, because of the well-recognized role of parental and early life environmental factors in later life psychopathology. Here we discuss the various forms of non-genetic inheritance in humans and animals, as well as rodent models of psychiatric conditions to illustrate possible mechanisms.}

abstract = {The {DNA} of each cell is wrapped around histone octamers, forming so-called 'nucleosomal core particles'. These histone proteins have tails that project from the nucleosome and many residues in these tails can be post-translationally modified, influencing all {DNA}-based processes, including chromatin compaction, nucleosome dynamics, and transcription. In contrast to those present in histone tails, modifications in the core regions of the histones had remained largely uncharacterised until recently, when some of these modifications began to be analysed in detail. Overall, recent work has shown that histone core modifications can not only directly regulate transcription, but also influence processes such as {DNA} repair, replication, stemness, and changes in cell state. In this review, we focus on the most recent developments in our understanding of histone modifications, particularly those on the lateral surface of the nucleosome. This region is in direct contact with the {DNA} and is formed by the histone cores. We suggest that these lateral surface modifications represent a key insight into chromatin regulation in the cell. Therefore, lateral surface modifications form a key area of interest and a focal point of ongoing study in epigenetics. Copyright \copyright 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

Recent genome-wide studies demonstrate that actively transcribed regions are characterized by a specific modification pattern of histones, the main protein component of chromatin. These findings support the hypothesis that a histone code uses histone post-translational modifications to stably inscribe particular chromatin structures into the genome. Experiments on the dynamics of histone modifications reveal a striking kinetic difference between methylation, phosphorylation and acetylation, suggesting different roles of these modifications in epigenetically fixing specific gene expression patterns.

abstract = {Transgenerational inheritance of environment induced phenotype requires transmission of epigenetic information through the germline. Whereas several epigenetic factors have been implicated in germline transmission, mediators of information transfer from soma to the germline remain unidentified in mammals. Notably, a recent bioinformatic analysis showed association of extracellular {microRNAs} ({miRNAs}) and altered transcriptomes in diverse instances of mammalian epigenetic inheritance involving different environmental factors, tissues, life cycle stages, generations and genders. It was predicted that regulatory non-coding {RNAs} ({ncRNAs}) may potentially mediate soma to germline information transfer. Remarkably, the present bioinformatic evidence suggests similar association of exosomal {mRNAs} and proteins. The differentially expressed genes reported previously in genome level expression profiling studies related to or relevant in epigenetic inheritance showed enrichment for documented set of exosomal {mRNAs} in a few instances of epigenetic inheritance and of exosomal proteins in a majority of instances. Differentially expressed genes encoding exosomal {miRNAs} and proteins, directly or indirectly through first and/or second degree interactome networks, overrepresented biological processes related to environmental factors used in these instances as well as to epigenetic alterations, especially chromatin and histone modifications. These findings predict that exosomal {mRNAs} and proteins, like extracellular {miRNAs}, may also potentially mediate soma to germline information transfer. A convergent conceptual model is presented wherein extracellular {ncRNAs}/{miRNA}, {mRNAs} and proteins provide the much needed continuum inclusive of epigenetic inheritance. The phrase "transgenerational systems biology" is introduced to signify that the realm of systems biology extends beyond an individual organism and encompasses generations.

abstract = {Germline copy number variants ({CNVs}) and somatic copy number alterations ({SCNAs}) are of significant importance in syndromic conditions and cancer. Massively parallel sequencing is increasingly used to infer copy number information from variations in the read depth in sequencing data. However, this approach has limitations in the case of targeted re-sequencing, which leaves gaps in coverage between the regions chosen for enrichment and introduces biases related to the efficiency of target capture and library preparation. We present a method for copy number detection, implemented in the software package {CNVkit}, that uses both the targeted reads and the nonspecifically captured off-target reads to infer copy number evenly across the genome. This combination achieves both exon-level resolution in targeted regions and sufficient resolution in the larger intronic and intergenic regions to identify copy number changes. In particular, we successfully inferred copy number at equivalent to 100-kilobase resolution genome-wide from a platform targeting as few as 293 genes. After normalizing read counts to a pooled reference, we evaluated and corrected for three sources of bias that explain most of the extraneous variability in the sequencing read depth: {GC} content, target footprint size and spacing, and repetitive sequences. We compared the performance of {CNVkit} to copy number changes identified by array comparative genomic hybridization. We packaged the components of {CNVkit} so that it is straightforward to use and provides visualizations, detailed reporting of significant features, and export options for integration into existing analysis pipelines. {CNVkit} is freely available from https://github.com/etal/cnvkit.}

abstract = {{MicroRNA} ({miRNA}) levels in serum have recently emerged as potential novel biomarkers for various diseases. {miRNAs} are routinely measured by standard quantitative real-time {PCR} ({qPCR}); however, the high sensitivity of {qPCR} demands appropriate normalization to correct for nonbiological variation. Presently, {RNU6B} (U6) is used for data normalization of circulating {miRNAs} in many studies. However, it was suggested that serum levels of U6 themselves might differ between individuals. Therefore, no consensus has been reached on the best normalization strategy in 'circulating {miRNA}'. We analyzed U6 levels as well as levels of spiked-in {SV40}-{RNA} in sera of 44 healthy volunteers, 203 intensive care unit patients and 64 patients with liver fibrosis. Levels of U6 demonstrated a high variability in sera of healthy donors, patients with critical illness and liver fibrosis. This high variability could also be confirmed in sera of mice after the cecal ligation and puncture procedure. Most importantly, levels of circulating U6 were significantly upregulated in sera of patients with critical illness and sepsis compared with controls and correlated with established markers of inflammation. In patients with liver fibrosis, U6 levels were significantly downregulated. In contrast, levels of spiked-in {SV40} displayed a significantly higher stability both in human cohorts (healthy, critical illness, liver fibrosis) and in mice. Thus, we conclude that U6 levels in the serum are dysregulated in a disease-specific manner. Therefore, U6 should not be used for data normalization of circulating {miRNAs} in inflammatory diseases and previous studies using this approach should be interpreted with caution. Further studies are warranted to identify specific regulatory processes of U6 levels in sepsis and liver fibrosis.}

abstract = {Sperm is a highly differentiated cell type whose function is to deliver a haploid genome to the oocyte. The sperm "epigenomes" were traditionally considered to be insignificant - the sperm is transcriptionally inactive, its genome is packaged in sperm-specific protamine toroids instead of nucleosomes, and its {DNA} methylation profile is erased immediately post-fertilization. Yet, in recent years there has been an increase in the number of reported cases of apparent epigenetic inheritance through the male germline, suggesting that the sperm epigenome may transmit information between generations. At the same time, technical advances have made the genome-wide profiling of different layers of the sperm epigenome feasible. As a result, a large number of datasets have been recently generated and analyzed with the aim to better understand what non-genetic material is contained within the sperm and whether it has any function post-fertilization. Here, we provide an overview of the current knowledge of the sperm epigenomes as well as the challenges in analysing them and the opportunities in understanding the potential non-genetic carriers of information in sperm.}

Recent papers argue that epigenetic marks acquired through experience are passed to offspring, but as in much of the field of epigenetics, there is lack of precision in the definitions and perhaps too much eagerness to translate animal research to humans. Here, we review operational definitions of transgenerational inheritance and the processes of epigenetic programing during early development. Subsequently, based on this background, we critically examine some recent findings of studies investigating transgenerational inheritance. Finally, we discuss possible mechanisms that may explain transgenerational inheritance, including transmission of an epigenetic blueprint, which may predispose offspring to specific epigenetic patterning. Taken together, we conclude that presently, the evidence suggesting that acquired epigenetic marks are passed to the subsequent generation remains limited.}

Release of extracellular vesicles from its cell of origin occurs either through the outward budding of the plasma membrane or through the inward budding of the endosomal membrane, resulting in the formation of multivesicular bodies, which release vesicles upon fusion with the plasma membrane. The release of vesicles can facilitate intercellular communication by contact with or by internalization of contents, either by fusion with the plasma membrane or by endocytosis into "recipient" cells. Although the interest in extracellular vesicle research is increasing, there are still no real standards in place to separate or classify the different types of vesicles.

In {RNA}-Seq however the artifactual reads are not easy to tell apart from normal read duplication due to natural over-sequencing of highly expressed genes. Especially when working with little input material or single cells assessing the fraction of duplicate reads is an important quality control step for {NGS} data sets. Up to now there are only tools to calculate the global duplication rates that do not take into account the effect of gene expression levels which leaves them of limited use for {RNA}-Seq data. {RESULTS}: Here we present the tool {dupRadar}, which provides an easy means to distinguish the fraction of reads originating in natural duplication due to high expression from the fraction induced by artefacts. {dupRadar} assesses the fraction of duplicate reads per gene dependent on the expression level.

Distinct patterns of histone modification are observed at specific chromosomal regions and affect various reactions on chromosomes (transcription, replication, repair, and recombination). Histone modification has long been proposed to have a profound effect on eukaryotic gene expression since its discovery in 1964. Verification of this idea, however, was difficult until the identification of enzymes responsible for histone modifications. Ten years ago (1995), histone acetyltransferases ({HATs}), which acetylate lysine residues in histone amino-terminal tail regions, were isolated. {HATs} are involved in the regulation of both promoter-specific transcription and long-range/chromosome-wide transcription. Analyses of {HATs} and other modification enzymes have revealed mechanisms of epigenetic regulation that are mediated by post-translational modifications of histones. Here we review some major advances in the field, with emphasis on the lysine specificity of the acetylation reaction and on the regulation of gene expression over broad regions.}

Commonly used {sRNA}-seq alignment methods result in either very low precision (choosing an alignment at random), or sensitivity (ignoring multi-mapping reads). Here, we describe and test an {sRNA}-seq alignment strategy that uses local genomic context to guide decisions on proper placements of multi-mapped {sRNA}-seq reads. Tests using simulated {sRNA}-seq data demonstrated that this local-weighting method outperforms other alignment strategies using three different plant genomes. Experimental analyses with real {sRNA}-seq data also indicate superior performance of local-weighting methods for both plant {miRNAs} and heterochromatic {siRNAs}.

Typical experimental design consists in comparing two conditions with several replicates using a differential gene expression test followed by preranked {GSEA} performed against a collection of hundreds and thousands of pathways. However, the reference implementation of this method cannot accurately estimate small P-values, which significantly limits its sensitivity due to multiple hypotheses correction procedure. Here we present {FGSEA} (Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) method that is able to estimate arbitrarily low {GSEA} P-values with a high accuracy in a matter of minutes or even seconds. To confirm the accuracy of the method, we also developed an exact algorithm for {GSEA} P-values calculation for integer gene-level statistics. Using the exact algorithm as a reference we show that {FGSEA} is able to routinely estimate P-values up to 10 −100 with a small and predictable estimation error. We systematically evaluate {FGSEA} on a collection of 605 datasets and show that {FGSEA} recovers much more statistically significant pathways compared to other implementations. {FGSEA} is open source and available as an R package in Bioconductor ( http://bioconductor.org/packages/fgsea/ ) and on {GitHub} ( https://github.com/ctlab/fgsea/ ).}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The concept that individual traits can be acquired and transmitted by the germline through epigenetic mechanisms has gained recognition in the past years. However, epigenetic marks in sperm have not been are not well identified. {RESULTS}: Using a novel proteomic approach that combines peptide-based bottom-up and intact protein top-down tandem mass spectrometry, we report the identification of epigenetic marks on histones and protamines in adult mouse sperm. We identified a total of 26 post-translational modifications ({PTMs}) on specific residues of the core histones {H2B}, H3 and H4, and the linker histone H1, four of which had not been described previously in any tissue or cell line. We also detected 11 novel {PTMs} on the protamines {PRM1} and {PRM2} and observed that they are present in specific combinations on individual protamines. {CONCLUSIONS}: Both histones and protamines carry multiple {PTMs} in the adult mouse sperm. On protamines, specific {PTM} combinations might form a 'protamine code' similar to the 'histone code'. These findings suggest a potential role for {PTMs} on sperm histones and protamines in epigenetic signatures underlying transgenerational inheritance.}

abstract = {The mammalian sperm genome is thought to lack substantial information for the regulation of future expression after fertilization. Here, we show that most promoters in mouse sperm are flanked by well-positioned nucleosomes marked by active histone modifications. Analysis of these modifications suggests that many enhancers and super-enhancers functional in embryonic and adult tissues are already specified in sperm. The sperm genome is bound by {CTCF} and cohesin at sites that are also present in round spermatids and embryonic stem cells ({ESCs}). These sites mediate interactions that organize the sperm genome into domains and compartments that overlap extensively with those found in {mESCs}. These results suggest that sperm carry a rich source of regulatory information, encoded in part by its three-dimensional folding specified by {CTCF} and cohesin. This information may contribute to future expression during embryonic and adult life, suggesting mechanisms by which environmental effects on the paternal germline are transmitted transgenerationally.

Unlike in somatic cells, there are few nucleosomes in sperm, and their function in epigenetic inheritance is unknown. We generated transgenic mice in which overexpression of the histone H3 lysine 4 ({H3K4}) demethylase {KDM1A} (also known as {LSD1}) during spermatogenesis reduced {H3K4} dimethylation in sperm. {KDM1A} overexpression in one generation severely impaired development and survivability of offspring. These defects persisted transgenerationally in the absence of {KDM1A} germline expression and were associated with altered {RNA} profiles in sperm and offspring.

Epigenetic marks are mitotically inherited in somatic cells and may be altered in response to internal and external stimuli. The idea that environment-induced epigenetic changes in mammals could be inherited through the germline, independent of genetic mechanisms, has stimulated much debate. Many experimental models have been designed to interrogate the possibility of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance and provide insight into how environmental exposures influence phenotypes over multiple generations in the absence of any apparent genetic mutation. Unexpected molecular evidence has forced us to reevaluate not only our understanding of the plasticity and heritability of epigenetic factors, but of the stability of the genome as well. Recent reviews have described the difference between transgenerational and intergenerational effects; the two major epigenetic reprogramming events in the mammalian lifecycle; these two events making transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of environment-induced perturbations rare, if at all possible, in mammals; and mechanisms of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in non-mammalian eukaryotic organisms. This paper briefly introduces these topics and mainly focuses on (1) transgenerational phenotypes and epigenetic effects in mammals, (2) environment-induced intergenerational epigenetic effects, and (3) the inherent difficulties in establishing a role for epigenetic inheritance in human environmental disease.

This non-genetic form of inheritance is termed epigenetic transgenerational inheritance and has been shown in a variety of species including plants, flies, worms, fish, rodents, pigs, and humans. This phenomenon operates during specific critical windows of exposure, linked to the developmental biology of the germ cells (sperm and eggs). Therefore, concepts of the developmental origins of transgenerational inheritance of phenotypic variation and subsequent disease risk need to include epigenetic processes affecting the developmental biology of the germ cell. These developmental impacts on epigenetic transgenerational inheritance, in contrast to multigenerational exposures, are the focus of this Perspective.}

This review focuses specifically on sperm {RNAs} as causal vectors of inheritance. We examine how they might become altered in the germline, and how different classes of sperm {RNAs} might interact with other epimodifications in germ cells or in the zygote.

Epigenetic marks, including {DNA} methylation, histones, chromatin structure, and noncoding {RNAs}, are modified throughout life in response to environmental and behavioral influences. With each new generation, {DNA} methylation patterns are erased in gametes and reset after fertilization, probably to prevent these epigenetic marks from being transferred from parents to their offspring. However, some recent animal studies suggest an apparent resistance to complete erasure of epigenetic marks during early development, enabling transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. Whether there are similar mechanisms in humans remains unclear, with the exception of epigenetic imprinting. Nevertheless, a distinctly different mechanism-namely, intrauterine exposure to environmental stressors that may affect establishment of the newly composing epigenetic patterns after fertilization-is often confused with transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. In this review, we delineate the definition of and requirement for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, differentiate it from the consequences of intrauterine exposure, and discuss the available evidence in both animal models and humans.-Van Otterdijk, S.

Furthermore, altered chromatin states can be transmitted to subsequent generations, thus epigenetic modifications may provide evolutionary mechanisms that impact on adaptation to changed environments.

Nextera combines {DNA} fragmentation and barcoding in a single tube reaction and therefore enables a very fast workflow to sequencing-ready {DNA} libraries within a couple of hours. When compared to the traditional ligation-based methods, transposed-based Nextera has a slight insertion bias. {RESULTS}: Here we present the discovery of a mutant transposase (Tn5-059) with a lowered {GC} insertion bias through protein engineering. We demonstrate Tn5-059 reduces {AT} dropout and increases uniformity of genome coverage in both bacterial genomes and human genome. We also observe higher library diversity generated by Tn5-059 when compared to Nextera v2 for human exomes, which leads to less sequencing and lower cost per genome. In addition, when used for human exomes, Tn5-059 delivers consistent library insert size over a range of input {DNA}, allowing up to a tenfold variance from the 50 ng input recommendation. {CONCLUSIONS}: Enhanced {DNA} input tolerance of Tn5-059 can translate to flexibility and robustness of workflow. {DNA} input tolerance together with superior uniformity of coverage and lower {AT} dropouts extend the applications of transposase based library preps.

Transplantation studies provided definitive evidence that a {TSPAN8}-high subpopulation is enriched for {\SSCs}. {RNA}-seq analyses identified genes differentially expressed between {TSPAN8}-high and -low subpopulations that clustered into multiple biological pathways potentially involved in {\SSC} renewal or differentiation, respectively. Methyl-seq analysis identified hypomethylated domains in the promoters of these genes in both subpopulations that colocalized with peaks of histone modifications defined by {ChIP}-seq analysis.

In recent years, there has been a proliferation of {GSE} analysis methods and hence it has become increasingly difficult for researchers to select an optimal {GSE} tool based on their particular dataset. Moreover, the majority of {GSE} analysis methods do not allow researchers to simultaneously compare gene set level results between multiple experimental conditions. Results: The ensemble of genes set enrichment analyses ({EGSEA}) is a method developed for {RNA}-sequencing data that combines results from twelve algorithms and calculates collective gene set scores to improve the biological relevance of the highest ranked gene sets. {EGSEA}'s gene set database contains around 25 000 gene sets from sixteen collections. It has multiple visualization capabilities that allow researchers to view gene sets at various levels of granularity. {EGSEA} has been tested on simulated data and on a number of human and mouse datasets and, based on biologists' feedback, consistently outperforms the individual tools that have been combined. Our evaluation demonstrates the superiority of the ensemble approach for {GSE} analysis, and its utility to effectively and efficiently extrapolate biological functions and potential involvement in disease processes from lists of differentially regulated genes.

Histones {H2A}, {H2B}, H3, and H4 are composed of two common regions, the "histone fold" and the "histone tail". Many efforts have been focused on the mechanisms by which the post-translational modifications of histone tails regulate the higher-order chromatin architecture. On the other hand, previous biochemical studies have suggested that histone tails also affect the structure and stability of the nucleosome core particle itself. However, the precise contributions of each histone tail are unclear. In the present study, we determined the crystal structures of four mutant nucleosomes, in which one of the four histones, {H2A}, {H2B}, H3, or H4, lacked the N-terminal tail. We found that the deletion of the {H2B} or H3 N-terminal tail affected histone-{DNA} interactions and substantially decreased nucleosome stability. These findings provide important information for understanding the complex roles of histone tails in regulating chromatin structure.}

Comparisons between the two methods have been carried out by various groups, but the assessments have relied largely on non-clinical samples. In this study, we evaluated these two {RNA} sequencing approaches using human blood and colon tissue samples. Our analyses showed that {rRNA} depletion captured more unique transcriptome features, whereas {polyA}+ selection outperformed {rRNA} depletion with higher exonic coverage and better accuracy of gene quantification. For blood- and colon-derived {RNAs}, we found that 220\% and 50\% more reads, respectively, would have to be sequenced to achieve the same level of exonic coverage in the {rRNA} depletion method compared with the {polyA}+ selection method. Therefore, in most cases we strongly recommend {polyA}+ selection over {rRNA} depletion for gene quantification in clinical {RNA} sequencing. Our evaluation revealed that a small number of {lncRNAs} and small {RNAs} made up a large fraction of the reads in the {rRNA} depletion {RNA} sequencing data. Thus, we recommend that these {RNAs} are specifically depleted to improve the sequencing depth of the remaining {RNAs}.}

abstract = {The inheritance of information beyond {DNA} sequence, known as epigenetic inheritance, has been implicated in a multitude of biological processes from control of plant flowering time to cancer in humans. In addition to epigenetic inheritance that occurs in dividing cells of a multicellular organism, it is also increasingly clear that at least some epigenetic information is transmitted via the gametes in a multitude of organisms, including mammals. Here, I review the evidence for epigenetic information carriers in mammalian sperm, and explore the emerging field of intergenerational transfer of environmental information.

abstract = {Although genomic {DNA} is the template of our heredity, it is the coordination and regulation of its expression that results in the wide complexity and diversity seen among organisms. In recent years, an emerging body of evidence has focused on the role of epigenetics as one mechanism by which gene expression can be maintained and modulated throughout the lifetime of an individual. Epigenetics refers to heritable alterations in gene expression that are not mediated by changes in primary {DNA} sequence and includes mitotic and/or meiotic events. In essence, epigenetic modulation results in functional adaptations of the genomic response to the environment and is believed to play a fundamental role in early developmental plasticity. This article focuses on several animal models that have been developed over the past decade to study epigenetic inheritance, many of which have arisen from the developmental origins of adult health and disease fields.

However, methods for the unsupervised integration of the resulting heterogeneous data sets are lacking. We present Multi-Omics Factor Analysis ({MOFA}), a computational method for discovering the principal sources of variation in multi-omics data sets. {MOFA} infers a set of (hidden) factors that capture biological and technical sources of variability. It disentangles axes of heterogeneity that are shared across multiple modalities and those specific to individual data modalities. The learnt factors enable a variety of downstream analyses, including identification of sample subgroups, data imputation and the detection of outlier samples. We applied {MOFA} to a cohort of 200 patient samples of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, profiled for somatic mutations, {RNA} expression, {DNA} methylation and ex vivo drug responses. {MOFA} identified major dimensions of disease heterogeneity, including immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region status, trisomy of chromosome 12 and previously underappreciated drivers, such as response to oxidative stress. In a second application, we used {MOFA} to analyse single-cell multi-omics data, identifying coordinated transcriptional and epigenetic changes along cell differentiation. \copyright 2018 The Authors.

Over the past 70 years the term has come in many colors and flavors, depending on the biological discipline and time period. The meanings span from Waddington's "epigenotype" and "epigenetic landscape" to the molecular biologists' "epigenetic marks" embodied by {DNA} methylation and histone modifications. Here we seek to quell the ambiguity of the name. First we place "epigenetic" in the various historical contexts. Then, by presenting the formal concepts of dynamical systems theory we show that the "epigenetic landscape" is more than a metaphor: it has specific mathematical foundations. The latter explains how gene regulatory networks produce multiple attractor states, the self-stabilizing patterns of gene activation across the genome that account for "epigenetic memory". This network dynamics approach replaces the reductionist correspondence of molecular epigenetic modifications with concept of the epigenetic landscape, by providing a concrete and crisp correspondence.}

However, it is unclear whether these state-of-the-art {RNA}-seq analysis pipelines can quantify small {RNAs} as accurately as they do with long {RNAs} in the context of total {RNA} quantification. {RESULT}: We comprehensively tested and compared four {RNA}-seq pipelines for accuracy of gene quantification and fold-change estimation. We used a novel total {RNA} benchmarking dataset in which small non-coding {RNAs} are highly represented along with other long {RNAs}. The four {RNA}-seq pipelines consisted of two commonly-used alignment-free pipelines and two variants of alignment-based pipelines. We found that all pipelines showed high accuracy for quantifying the expression of long and highly-abundant genes. However, alignment-free pipelines showed systematically poorer performance in quantifying lowly-abundant and small {RNAs}. {CONCLUSION}: We have shown that alignment-free and traditional alignment-based quantification methods perform similarly for common gene targets, such as protein-coding genes. However, we have identified a potential pitfall in analyzing and quantifying lowly-expressed genes and small {RNAs} with alignment-free pipelines, especially when these small {RNAs} contain biological variations.}

abstract = {3' untranslated regions (3' {UTRs}) of messenger {RNAs} ({mRNAs}) are best known to regulate {mRNA}-based processes, such as {mRNA} localization, {mRNA} stability, and translation. In addition, 3' {UTRs} can establish 3' {UTR}-mediated protein-protein interactions ({PPIs}), and thus can transmit genetic information encoded in 3' {UTRs} to proteins. This function has been shown to regulate diverse protein features, including protein complex formation or posttranslational modifications, but is also expected to alter protein conformations. Therefore, 3' {UTR}-mediated information transfer can regulate protein features that are not encoded in the amino acid sequence. This review summarizes both 3' {UTR} functions-the regulation of {mRNA} and protein-based processes-and highlights how each 3' {UTR} function was discovered with a focus on experimental approaches used and the concepts that were learned. This review also discusses novel approaches to study 3' {UTR} functions in the future by taking advantage of recent advances in technology.

In the case of {RNA}-Seq, transcriptome pseudoalignment of reads is a fast alternative to genome alignment, but the different coordinate systems of the genome and transcriptome have made it difficult to perform direct comparisons between the approaches. Results: We have developed tools for converting genome alignments to transcriptome pseudoalignments, and conversely, for projecting transcriptome pseudoalignments to genome alignments. Using these tools, we performed a direct comparison of genome alignment with transcriptome pseudoalignment. We find that both approaches produce similar quantifications. This means that for many applications genome alignment and transcriptome pseudoalignment are interchangeable.

Solexa sequencing followed by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays was used to test for differences in the levels of {miRNAs} between survivors and non-survivors. {miR}-223, {miR}-15a, {miR}-16, {miR}-122, {miR}-193*, and {miR}-483-5p were significantly differentially expressed.

Logistic regression analysis showed that sepsis stage, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation {II} scores, {miR}-15a, {miR}-16, {miR}-193b*, and {miR}-483-5p were associated with death from sepsis. An analysis was done using these seven variables combined. The {AUC} for these combined variables' predictive probability was 0.953 (95\% {CI}: 0.923-0.983), which was much higher than the {AUCs} for Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation {II} scores (0.782; 95\% {CI}: 0.712-0.851), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores (0.752; 95\% {CI}: 0.672-0.832), and procalcitonin levels (0.689; 95\% {CI}: 0.611-0.784). With a cut-off point of 0.550, the predictive value of the seven variables had a sensitivity of 88.5\% and a specificity of 90.4\%. Additionally, {miR}-193b* had the highest odds ratio for sepsis mortality of 9.23 (95\% {CI}: 1.20-71.16). {CONCLUSION}/{SIGNIFICANCE}: Six serum {miRNA}'s were identified as prognostic predictors for sepsis patients. {TRIAL} {REGISTRATION}: {ClinicalTrials}.gov {NCT01207531}.}

abstract = {The specific post-translational modifications of the histone proteins are associated with specific {DNA}-templated processes, such as transcriptional activation or repression. To investigate the biological role(s) of histone H4 lysine 20 (H4 Lys-20) methylation, we created a novel panel of antibodies that specifically detected mono-, di-, or trimethylated H4 Lys-20. We report that the different methylated forms of H4 Lys-20 are compartmentalized within visually distinct, transcriptionally silent regions in the mammalian nucleus. Interestingly, direct comparison of methylated H4 Lys-20 with the different methylated states of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3 Lys-9) revealed significant overlap and exclusion between the specific groups of methyl modifications. Trimethylated H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 were both selectively enriched within pericentric heterochromatin. Similarly, monomethylated H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 partitioned together and the dimethylated forms partitioned together within the chromosome arms; however, the mono- and dimethylated modifications were virtually exclusive. These findings strongly suggest that the combinatorial presence or absence of the different methylated states of H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 define particular types of silent chromatin. Consistent with this, detailed analysis of monomethylated H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 revealed that both were preferentially and selectively enriched within the same nucleosome particle in vivo. Collectively, these findings define a novel trans-tail histone code involving monomethylated H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 that act cooperatively to mark distinct regions of silent chromatin within the mammalian epigenome.}

abstract = {Heterochromatic gene silencing is an important form of gene regulation that usually requires specific histone modifications. A popular model posits that inheritance of modified histones, especially in the form of H3-H4 tetramers, underlies inheritance of heterochromatin. Because H3-H4 tetramers are randomly distributed between daughter chromatids during {DNA} replication, rare occurrences of asymmetric tetramer inheritance within a heterochromatic domain would have the potential to destabilize heterochromatin. This model makes a prediction that shorter heterochromatic domains would experience unbalanced tetramer inheritance more frequently, and thereby be less stable. In contrast to this prediction, we found that shortening a heterochromatic domain in Saccharomyces had no impact on the strength of silencing nor its heritability. Additionally, we found that replisome mutations that disrupt inheritance of H3-H4 tetramers had only minor effects on heterochromatin stability. These findings suggest that histones carry little or no memory of the heterochromatin state through {DNA} replication. \copyright 2019, Saxton and Rine.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Huntington's Disease ({HD}) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by a {CAG} repeat expansion, resulting in a mutant huntingtin protein. While it is now clear that astrocytes are affected by {HD} and significantly contribute to neuronal dysfunction and pathogenesis, the alterations in the transcriptional and epigenetic profiles in {HD} astrocytes have yet to be characterized. Here, we examine global transcription and chromatin accessibility dynamics during in vitro astrocyte differentiation in a transgenic non-human primate model of {HD}. {RESULTS}: We found global changes in accessibility and transcription across different stages of {HD} pluripotent stem cell differentiation, with distinct trends first observed in neural progenitor cells ({NPCs}), once cells have committed to a neural lineage. Transcription of p53 signaling and cell cycle pathway genes was highly impacted during differentiation, with depletion in {HD} {NPCs} and upregulation in {HD} astrocytes. {E2F} target genes also displayed this inverse expression pattern, and strong associations between {E2F} target gene expression and accessibility at nearby putative enhancers were observed. {CONCLUSIONS}: The results suggest that chromatin accessibility and transcription are altered throughout in vitro {HD} astrocyte differentiation and provide evidence that {E2F} dysregulation contributes to aberrant cell-cycle re-entry and apoptosis throughout the progression from {NPCs} to astrocytes.}

abstract = {{miRNAs} are small non-coding {RNAs} of about 18-25 nucleotides that negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. It was reported that a deregulation of their expression patterns correlates to the onset and progression of various diseases. Recently, these molecules have been identified in a great plethora of biological fluids, and have also been proposed as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Actually, real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction is the most widely used approach for circulating {miRNAs} (c-{miRNAs}) expression profiling. Nevertheless, the debate on the choice of the most suitable endogenous reference genes for c-{miRNAs} expression levels normalization is still open. In this regard, numerous research groups are focusing their efforts upon identifying specific, highly stable, endogenous c-{mRNAs}. The aim of this review is to provide an overview on the reference genes currently used in the study of various pathologies, offering to researchers the opportunity to select the appropriate molecules for c-{miRNA} levels normalization, when their choosing is based upon literature data.}

abstract = {{CONFOUNDING} {FACTORS}: In transcriptomics experimentation, confounding factors frequently exist alongside the intended experimental factors and can severely influence the outcome of a transcriptome analysis. Confounding factors are regularly discussed in methodological literature, but their actual, practical impact on the outcome and interpretation of transcriptomics experiments is, to our knowledge, not documented. For instance, in-vivo experimental factors; like Individual, Sample-Composition and Time-of-Day are potentially formidable confounding factors. To study these confounding factors, we designed an extensive in-vivo transcriptome experiment (n = 264) with {UVR} exposure of murine skin containing six consecutive samples from each individual mouse (n = 64). {ANALYSIS} {APPROACH}: Evaluation of the confounding factors: Sample-Composition, Time-of-Day, Handling-Stress, and Individual-Mouse resulted in the identification of many genes that were affected by them. These genes sometimes showed over 30-fold expression differences. The most prominent confounding factor was Sample-Composition caused by mouse-dependent skin composition differences, sampling variation and/or influx/efflux of mobile cells. Although we can only evaluate these effects for known cell type specifically expressed genes in our complex heterogeneous samples, it is clear that the observed variations also affect the cumulative expression levels of many other non-cell-type-specific genes. {ANOVA}: {ANOVA} analysis can only attempt to neutralize the effects of the well-defined confounding factors, such as Individual-Mouse, on the experimental factors {UV}-Dose and Recovery-Time. Also, by definition, {ANOVA} only yields reproducible gene-expression differences, but we found that these differences were very small compared to the fold changes induced by the confounding factors, questioning the biological relevance of these {ANOVA}-detected differences. Furthermore, it turned out that many of the differentially expressed genes found by {ANOVA} were also present in the gene clusters associated with the confounding factors. {CONCLUSION}: Hence our overall conclusion is that confounding factors have a major impact on the outcome of in-vivo transcriptomics experiments. Thus the set-up, analysis, and interpretation of such experiments should be approached with the utmost prudence.}

abstract = {Numerous studies in humans and in animal models have demonstrated that exposure to adverse environmental conditions in early life results in long-term structural and functional changes in an organism, increasing the risk of cardiometabolic, neurobehavioural and reproductive disorders in later life. Such effects are not limited to the first generation offspring but may be transmitted to a second or a number of subsequent generations, through non-genomic mechanisms. While the transmission of 'programmed' effects through the maternal line could occur as a consequence of multiple influences, for example, altered maternal physiology, the inheritance of effects through the male line is more difficult to explain and there is much interest in a potential role for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. In this review, we will discuss the mechanisms by which induced effects may be transmitted through the paternal lineage, with a particular focus on the role of epigenetic inheritance.

abstract = {The term 'extracellular vesicles' refers to a heterogeneous population of vesicular bodies of cellular origin that derive either from the endosomal compartment (exosomes) or as a result of shedding from the plasma membrane (microvesicles, oncosomes and apoptotic bodies). Extracellular vesicles carry a variety of cargo, including {RNAs}, proteins, lipids and {DNA}, which can be taken up by other cells, both in the direct vicinity of the source cell and at distant sites in the body via biofluids, and elicit a variety of phenotypic responses. Owing to their unique biology and roles in cell-cell communication, extracellular vesicles have attracted strong interest, which is further enhanced by their potential clinical utility. Because extracellular vesicles derive their cargo from the contents of the cells that produce them, they are attractive sources of biomarkers for a variety of diseases. Furthermore, studies demonstrating phenotypic effects of specific extracellular vesicle-associated cargo on target cells have stoked interest in extracellular vesicles as therapeutic vehicles. There is particularly strong evidence that the {RNA} cargo of extracellular vesicles can alter recipient cell gene expression and function. During the past decade, extracellular vesicles and their {RNA} cargo have become better defined, but many aspects of extracellular vesicle biology remain to be elucidated. These include selective cargo loading resulting in substantial differences between the composition of extracellular vesicles and source cells; heterogeneity in extracellular vesicle size and composition; and undefined mechanisms for the uptake of extracellular vesicles into recipient cells and the fates of their cargo. Further progress in unravelling the basic mechanisms of extracellular vesicle biogenesis, transport, and cargo delivery and function is needed for successful clinical implementation. This Review focuses on the current state of knowledge pertaining to packaging, transport and function of {RNAs} in extracellular vesicles and outlines the progress made thus far towards their clinical applications.}

Here we briefly examine the literature on transgenerational actions of endocrine disrupting chemicals ({EDCs}) on brain and behavior and their underlying epigenetic mechanisms including: {DNA} methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding {RNAs}. We stress that epigenetic modifications need to be examined in a synergistic manner, as they act together in situ on chromatin to change transcription. Next we highlight recent work from one of our laboratories ({VGC}). The data provide new evidence that the sperm genome is poised for transcription. In developing sperm, gene enhancers and promoters are accessible for transcription and these activating motifs are also found in preimplantation embryos. Thus, {DNA} modifications associated with transcription factors during fertilization, in primordial germ cells ({PGCs}), and/or during germ cell maturation may be passed to offspring. We discuss the implications of this model to {EDC} exposures and speculate on whether natural variation in hormone levels during fertilization and {PGC} migration may impart transgenerational effects on brain and behavior. Lastly we discuss how this mechanism could apply to neural sexual differentiation. Copyright \copyright 2020. Published by Elsevier Inc.}

As evidence for germline non-genetic inheritance of phenotypes and diseases continues to grow in model organisms, there are fewer reports of this phenomenon in humans, due to a variety of complications in evaluating this mechanism of inheritance in humans. This review summarizes the evidence for germline-based non-genetic inheritance in humans, as well as the significant challenges and important caveats that must be considered when evaluating this process in human populations. Most reports of this process evaluate the association of a lifetime exposure in ancestors with changes in {DNA} methylation or small {RNA} expression in germ cells, as well as the association between ancestral experiences and the inheritance of a phenotype in descendants, down to great-grandchildren in some cases. Collectively, these studies provide evidence that phenotypes can be inherited in a {DNA}-independent manner; the extent to which this process contributes to disease development, as well as the cellular and molecular regulation of this process, remain largely undefined.}

Here, we developed a cell-based assay in which {EVs} containing luciferase- or fluorescent-protein tagged cytosolic cargoes are loaded on unlabeled acceptor cells. Results from dose-responses, kinetics, and temperature-block experiments suggest that {EV} uptake is a low yield process (\~1\% spontaneous rate at 1 h). Further characterization of this limited {EV} uptake, through fractionation of membranes and cytosol, revealed cytosolic release (\~30\% of the uptaken {EVs}) in acceptor cells. This release is inhibited by bafilomycin A1 and overexpression of {IFITM} proteins, which prevent virus entry and fusion. Our results show that {EV} content release requires endosomal acidification and suggest the involvement of membrane fusion.}

Here we show that exposure of pregnant mouse F0 females during E7.5-E13.5 to bisphenol A results in obesity in the F2 progeny in the absence of additional exposure. This epiphenotype can be transmitted through the male and female germlines up to the F5 generation, decreases in F6, and disappears in F7. Analysis of chromatin changes in the sperm of the F1 generation reveals a widespread increase in chromatin accessibility at binding sites for {CTCF} and other transcription factors accompanied by alterations in {3D} organization. Comparison of the transmission of obesity between F2 and F5 and its disappearance in F7 with alterations in the binding of these transcription factors points to the activation of an enhancer in an intron of the Fto gene as the cause of transgenerational inheritance. Activation of the Fto enhancer results in a decrease of {m6A} in sperm {RNAs}, which may result in alterations of gene expression in the embryo after fertilization. Given the established involvement of {SNPs} in {FTO} in human obesity, the results suggest that both genetic and epigenetic alterations of the same gene can lead to the same phenotypic outcomes on human health.}

In addition, we discuss the specific neurodevelopmental growth syndromes and cancers resulting from pathogenic mutations in the human orthologues of these genes. Integrating these observations underscores the fundamental importance of crosstalk between {DNA} and histone H3 methylation in development and disease. \copyright 2021. Springer Nature Limited.}

abstract = {For the past 120 years, the Weismann barrier and associated germ plasm theory of heredity have been a doctrine that has impacted evolutionary biology and our concepts of inheritance through the germline. Although August Weismann in his 1872 book was correct that the sperm and egg were the only cells to transmit molecular information to the subsequent generation, the concept that somatic cells do not impact the germline (i.e., the Weismann barrier) is incorrect. However, the doctrine or dogma of the Weismann barrier still influences many scientific fields and topics. The discovery of epigenetics, and more recently environmentally induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of phenotypic variation and pathology, have had significant impacts on evolution theory and medicine today. Environmental epigenetics and the concept of epigenetic transgenerational inheritance refute aspects of the Weismann barrier and require a re-evaluation of both inheritance theory and evolution theory.}

abstract = {Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in animals has increasingly been reported in recent years. Controversies, however, surround this unconventional mode of heredity, especially in mammals, for several reasons. First, its existence itself has been questioned due to perceived insufficiency of available evidence. Second, it potentially implies transfer of hereditary information from soma to germline, against the established principle in biology. Third, it inherently requires survival of epigenetic memory across reprogramming, posing another fundamental challenge in biology. Fourth, evolutionary significance of epigenetic inheritance has also been under debate. This article pointwise addresses all these concerns on the basis of recent empirical, theoretical and conceptual advances. 1) Described here in detail are the key experimental findings demonstrating the occurrence of germline epigenetic inheritance in mammals. 2) Newly emerging evidence supporting soma to germline communication in transgenerational inheritance in mammals, and a role of exosome and extracellular {microRNA} in this transmission, is thoroughly discussed. 3) The plausibility of epigenetic information propagation across reprogramming is highlighted. 4) Analyses supporting evolutionary significance of epigenetic inheritance are briefly mentioned. Finally, an integrative model of 'evolutionary transgenerational systems biology' is proposed to provide a framework to guide future advancements in epigenetic inheritance.}

abstract = {The testis is a key male reproductive organ that produces gametes through the process of spermatogenesis. Testis morphologies and spermatogenesis evolve rapidly in mammals, presumably due to the evolutionary pressure on males to be reproductively successful. The rapid evolution of the testis was shown to be reflected at the molecular level based on bulk-tissue work, but the molecular evolution of individual spermatogenic cell types across mammalian lineages remains largely uncharacterized. Here we report evolutionary analyses of single-nucleus transcriptome data for testes from eleven species that cover the three major mammalian lineages (eutherians, marsupials, egg-laying monotremes) and birds (the evolutionary outgroup), and include seven key primates. Our analyses reveal that the rapid evolution of the testis is driven by accelerated fixation rates of gene expression changes, amino acid altering substitutions, and newly emerged genes in late spermatogenic stages - likely facilitated by reduced pleiotropic constraints, haploid selection, and a transcriptionally permissive chromatin environment. We identify temporal expression changes of individual genes across species, which may have contributed to the emergence of species-specific phenotypes, but also conserved expression programs underlying ancestral spermatogenic processes. Sex chromosome analyses show that genes predominantly expressed in spermatogonia (i.e., germ cells fueling spermatogenesis) and Sertoli cells (i.e., somatic supporting cells) independently accumulated on X chromosomes across mammals during evolution, presumably due to male-beneficial selective forces. Further work uncovered that the process of meiotic sex chromosome inactivation ({MSCI}) also occurs in monotremes and hence is common to the different mammalian sex chromosome systems, contrary to previous inferences. Thus, the general mechanism of meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin ({MSUC}), which underlies {MSCI}, represents an ancestral mammalian feature. Together, our study illuminates the cellular and molecular evolution of mammalian spermatogenesis and associated selective forces, and provides a resource for investigating the biology of the testis across mammals.}

abstract = {Transcriptionally active chromatin is marked by tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 ({H3K4me3}) located after first exons and around transcription start sites. This epigenetic mark is typically restricted to narrow regions at the 5`end of the gene body, though a small subset of genes have a broad {H3K4me3} domain which extensively covers the coding region. Although most studies focus on the {H3K4me3} mark, the broad {H3K4me3} domain is associated with a plethora of histone modifications (e.g., H3 acetylated at K27) and is therein termed broad epigenetic domain. Genes marked with the broad epigenetic domain are involved in cell identity and essential cell functions and have clinical potential as biomarkers for patient stratification. Reducing expression of genes with the broad epigenetic domain may increase the metastatic potential of cancer cells. Enhancers and super-enhancers interact with the broad epigenetic domain marked genes forming a hub of interactions involving nucleosome-depleted regions. Together, the regulatory elements coalesce with transcription factors, chromatin modifying/remodeling enzymes, coactivators, and the Mediator and/or Integrator complex into a transcription factory which may be analogous to a liquid-liquid phase-separated condensate. The broad epigenetic domain has a dynamic chromatin structure which supports frequent transcription bursts. In this review, we present the current knowledge of broad epigenetic domains.}

abstract = {During fertilization, two of the most differentiated cells in the mammalian organism, a sperm and oocyte, are combined to form a pluripotent embryo. Dynamic changes in chromatin structure allow the transition of the chromatin on these specialized cells into an embryonic configuration capable of generating every cell type. Initially, this reprogramming activity is supported by oocyte-derived factors accumulated during oogenesis as proteins and {mRNAs}; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms that govern it remain poorly characterized. Trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 ({H3K27me3}) is a repressive epigenetic mark that changes dynamically during pre-implantation development in mice, bovine and pig embryos. Here we present data and hypotheses related to the potential mechanisms behind {H3K27me3} remodeling during early development. We postulate that the repressive {H3K27me3} mark is globally erased from the parental genomes in order to remove the gametic epigenetic program and to establish a pluripotent embryonic epigenome. We discuss information gathered in mice, pigs, and bovine, with the intent of providing a comparative analysis of the reprogramming of this epigenetic mark during early mammalian development.}

These stimuli affect gene expression through intricate mechanisms of regulation that largely implicate epigenetic factors, such as, {DNA} methylation, histone post-translational modifications, and non-coding {RNAs} ({ncRNAs}). Through these molecular pathways, some of the behavioral phenotypes associated with life experiences can be stably transmitted to descendants, sometimes across several generations. Rodent studies indicate that parental stressful and traumatic experiences can lead to behavioral despair, risk-taking behaviors, altered sociability and atypical responses to stressful stimuli in the offspring, whereas parental environmental enrichment has been associated with improved cognition and stress resilience in the offspring. Similar observations have been made in humans; children and grandchildren of genocide survivors show increased psychopathology and emotional disturbances. At the molecular level, changes in germline {ncRNAs} have been identified as likely vectors of transmission in rodents. The mechanisms linking behavioral stimuli to the germline, and factors responsible for these changes and their persistence across generations remain, however, largely unidentified.}

Although it is generally accepted that the transcriptome of spermatogonial cells is different in postnatal life and adulthood, it is not known if the genome landscape at the chromatin level is also different across age. We characterized the transcriptome and chromatin landscape of spermatogonial cells by {RNA}-seq and {ATAC}-seq using enriched populations at different postnatal stages and in adulthood, and established a comprehensive multiparametric profiling building on published epigenetic datasets. Our results validate previously described changes in gene expression between postnatal and adult stages, and reveal novel transcriptomic transitions. We show that extensive chromatin remodeling takes place in adult spermatogonial cells that is accompanied by distinct transcription factor dynamics and histone modifications. The data identify chromatin and transcription factor dynamics at common repeat elements in postnatal and adult spermatogonia. Overall, our results provide new knowledge about the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape of spermatogonial cells across postnatal stages until adulthood, and provide a valuable resource for germ cell studies.}

Comparisons between the two methods have been carried out by various groups, but the assessments have relied largely on non-clinical samples. In this study, we evaluated these two {RNA} sequencing approaches using human blood and colon tissue samples. Our analyses showed that {rRNA} depletion captured more unique transcriptome features, whereas {polyA}+ selection outperformed {rRNA} depletion with higher exonic coverage and better accuracy of gene quantification. For blood- and colon-derived {RNAs}, we found that 220\% and 50\% more reads, respectively, would have to be sequenced to achieve the same level of exonic coverage in the {rRNA} depletion method compared with the {polyA}+ selection method. Therefore, in most cases we strongly recommend {polyA}+ selection over {rRNA} depletion for gene quantification in clinical {RNA} sequencing. Our evaluation revealed that a small number of {lncRNAs} and small {RNAs} made up a large fraction of the reads in the {rRNA} depletion {RNA} sequencing data. Thus, we recommend that these {RNAs} are specifically depleted to improve the sequencing depth of the remaining {RNAs}.}
