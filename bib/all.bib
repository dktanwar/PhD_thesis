Here, we report the results of an international collaboration to produce a high-quality draft sequence of the mouse genome. We also present an initial comparative analysis of the mouse and human genomes, describing some of the insights that can be gleaned from the two sequences. We discuss topics including the analysis of the evolutionary forces shaping the size, structure and sequence of the genomes; the conservation of large-scale synteny across most of the genomes; the much lower extent of sequence orthology covering less than half of the genomes; the proportions of the genomes under selection; the number of protein-coding genes; the expansion of gene families related to reproduction and immunity; the evolution of proteins; and the identification of intraspecies polymorphism.}

We constructed {RRBS} libraries from murine {ES} cells and from {ES} cells lacking {DNA} methyltransferases Dnmt3a and 3b and with knocked-down (kd) levels of Dnmt1 (Dnmt[1(kd),3a-/-,3b-/-]). Sequencing of 960 {RRBS} clones from Dnmt[1(kd),3a-/-,3b-/-] cells generated 343 kb of non-redundant bisulfite sequence covering 66212 cytosines in the genome. All but 38 cytosines had been converted to uracil indicating a conversion rate of \textgreater99.9\%. Of the remaining cytosines 35 were found in {CpG} and 3 in {CpT} dinucleotides. Non-{CpG} methylation was \textgreater250-fold reduced compared with wild-type {ES} cells, consistent with a role for Dnmt3a and/or Dnmt3b in {CpA} and {CpT} methylation. Closer inspection revealed neither a consensus sequence around the methylated sites nor evidence for clustering of residual methylation in the genome. Our findings indicate random loss rather than specific maintenance of methylation in Dnmt[1(kd),3a-/-,3b-/-] cells. Near-complete bisulfite conversion and largely unbiased representation of {RRBS} libraries suggest that random shotgun bisulfite sequencing can be scaled to a genome-wide approach.}

abstract = {{DNase} I hypersensitive sites ({DHSs}) are markers of regulatory {DNA} and have underpinned the discovery of all classes of cis-regulatory elements including enhancers, promoters, insulators, silencers and locus control regions. Here we present the first extensive map of human {DHSs} identified through genome-wide profiling in 125 diverse cell and tissue types. We identify ∼2.9 million {DHSs} that encompass virtually all known experimentally validated cis-regulatory sequences and expose a vast trove of novel elements, most with highly cell-selective regulation. Annotating these elements using {ENCODE} data reveals novel relationships between chromatin accessibility, transcription, {DNA} methylation and regulatory factor occupancy patterns. We connect ∼580,000 distal {DHSs} with their target promoters, revealing systematic pairing of different classes of distal {DHSs} and specific promoter types. Patterning of chromatin accessibility at many regulatory regions is organized with dozens to hundreds of co-activated elements, and the transcellular {DNase} I sensitivity pattern at a given region can predict cell-type-specific functional behaviours. The {DHS} landscape shows signatures of recent functional evolutionary constraint. However, the {DHS} compartment in pluripotent and immortalized cells exhibits higher mutation rates than that in highly differentiated cells, exposing an unexpected link between chromatin accessibility, proliferative potential and patterns of human variation.}

abstract = {Both {DNA} methylation and histone modification are involved in establishing patterns of gene repression during development. Certain forms of histone methylation cause local formation of heterochromatin, which is readily reversible, whereas {DNA} methylation leads to stable long-term repression. It has recently become apparent that {DNA} methylation and histone modification pathways can be dependent on one another, and that this crosstalk can be mediated by biochemical interactions between {SET} domain histone methyltransferases and {DNA} methyltransferases. Relationships between {DNA} methylation and histone modification have implications for understanding normal development as well as somatic cell reprogramming and tumorigenesis.}

The {GENCODE} 7 release contains 20,687 protein-coding and 9640 long noncoding {RNA} loci and has 33,977 coding transcripts not represented in {UCSC} genes and {RefSeq}. It also has the most comprehensive annotation of long noncoding {RNA} ({lncRNA}) loci publicly available with the predominant transcript form consisting of two exons. We have examined the completeness of the transcript annotation and found that 35\% of transcriptional start sites are supported by {CAGE} clusters and 62\% of protein-coding genes have annotated {polyA} sites. Over one-third of {GENCODE} protein-coding genes are supported by peptide hits derived from mass spectrometry spectra submitted to Peptide Atlas.

Their presence on histones can dictate the higher-order chromatin structure in which {DNA} is packaged and can orchestrate the ordered recruitment of enzyme complexes to manipulate {DNA}.

abstract = {Complex patterns of histone lysine methylation encode distinct functions within chromatin. We previously reported that trimethylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 ({H3K9}) occurs at both silent heterochromatin and at the transcribed regions of active mammalian genes, suggesting that the extent of histone lysine methylation involved in mammalian gene activation is not completely defined. To identify additional sites of histone methylation that respond to mammalian gene activity, we describe here a comparative assessment of all six known positions of histone lysine methylation and relate them to gene transcription. Using several model loci, we observed high trimethylation of {H3K4}, {H3K9}, {H3K36}, and {H3K79} in the transcribed region, consistent with previous findings. We identify {H4K20} monomethylation, a modification previously linked with repression, as a mark of transcription elongation in mammalian cells. In contrast, {H3K27} monomethylation, a modification enriched at pericentromeric heterochromatin, was observed broadly distributed throughout all euchromatic sites analyzed, with selective depletion in the vicinity of the transcription start sites at active genes. Together, these results underscore that similar to other described methyl-lysine modifications, {H4K20} and {H3K27} monomethylation are versatile and dynamic with respect to gene activity, suggesting the existence of novel site-specific methyltransferases and demethylases coupled to the transcription cycle.}

abstract = {Retrotransposable elements comprise around 50\% of the mammalian genome. Their activity represents a constant threat to the host and has prompted the development of adaptive control mechanisms to protect genome architecture and function. To ensure their propagation, retrotransposons have to mobilize in cells destined for the next generation. Accordingly, these elements are particularly well suited to transcriptional networks associated with pluripotent and germinal states in mammals. The relaxation of epigenetic control that occurs in the early developing germline constitutes a dangerous window in which retrotransposons can escape from host restraint and massively expand. What could be observed as risky behavior may turn out to be an insidious strategy developed by germ cells to sense retrotransposons and hold them back in check. Herein, we review recent insights that have provided a detailed picture of the defense mechanisms that concur toward retrotransposon silencing in mammalian genomes, and in particular in the germline. In this lineage, retrotransposons are hit at multiple stages of their life cycle, through transcriptional repression, {RNA} degradation and translational control. An organized cross-talk between {PIWI}-interacting small {RNAs} ({piRNAs}) and various nuclear and cytoplasmic accessories provides this potent and multi-layered response to retrotransposon unleashing in early germ cells.}

abstract = {{DNA} methylation is an ancient molecular modification found in most eukaryotes. In plants, {DNA} methylation is not only critical for transcriptionally silencing transposons, but can also affect phenotype by altering expression of protein coding genes. The extent of its contribution to phenotypic diversity over evolutionary time is, however, unclear, because of limited stability of epialleles that are not linked to {DNA} mutations. To dissect the relative contribution of {DNA} methylation to transposon surveillance and host gene regulation, we leveraged information from three species in the Brassicaceae that vary in genome architecture, Capsella rubella, Arabidopsis lyrata, and Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that the lineage-specific expansion and contraction of transposon and repeat sequences is the main driver of interspecific differences in {DNA} methylation. The most heavily methylated portions of the genome are thus not conserved at the sequence level. Outside of repeat-associated methylation, there is a surprising degree of conservation in methylation at single nucleotides located in gene bodies. Finally, dynamic {DNA} methylation is affected more by tissue type than by environmental differences in all species, but these responses are not conserved. The majority of {DNA} methylation variation between species resides in hypervariable genomic regions, and thus, in the context of macroevolution, is of limited phenotypic consequence.}

We demonstrate how {GSEA} yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, {GSEA} reveals many biological pathways in common. The {GSEA} method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.}

Currently available {RNA}-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases. {RESULTS}: To align our large (\textgreater80 billon reads) {ENCODE} Transcriptome {RNA}-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference ({STAR}) software based on a previously undescribed {RNA}-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. {STAR} outperforms other aligners by a factor of \textgreater50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, {STAR} can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length {RNA} sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the {STAR} mapping strategy. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: {STAR} is implemented as a standalone C++ code. {STAR} is free open source software distributed under {GPLv3} license and can be downloaded from http://code.google.com/p/rna-star/.}

abstract = {Rapid advances in the life sciences and in related information technologies necessitate the ongoing refinement of bioinformatics educational programs in order to maintain their relevance. As the discipline of bioinformatics and computational biology expands and matures, it is important to characterize the elements that contribute to the success of professionals in this field. These individuals work in a wide variety of settings, including bioinformatics core facilities, biological and medical research laboratories, software development organizations, pharmaceutical and instrument development companies, and institutions that provide education, service, and training. In response to this need, the Curriculum Task Force of the International Society for Computational Biology ({ISCB}) Education Committee seeks to define curricular guidelines for those who train and educate bioinformaticians. The previous report of the task force summarized a survey that was conducted to gather input regarding the skill set needed by bioinformaticians [1]. The current article details a subsequent effort, wherein the task force broadened its perspectives by examining bioinformatics career opportunities, surveying directors of bioinformatics core facilities, and reviewing bioinformatics education programs. The bioinformatics literature provides valuable perspectives on bioinformatics education by defining skill sets needed by bioinformaticians, presenting approaches for providing informatics training to biologists, and discussing the roles of bioinformatics core facilities in training and education. The skill sets required for success in the field of bioinformatics are considered by several authors: Altman [2] defines five broad areas of competency and lists key technologies; Ranganathan [3] presents highlights from the Workshops on Education in Bioinformatics, discussing challenges and possible solutions; Yale's interdepartmental {PhD} program in computational biology and bioinformatics is described in [4], which lists the general areas of knowledge of bioinformatics; in a related article, a graduate of Yale's {PhD} program reflects on the skills needed by a bioinformatician [5]; Altman and Klein [6] describe the Stanford Biomedical Informatics ({BMI}) Training Program, presenting observed trends among {BMI} students; the American Medical Informatics Association defines competencies in the related field of biomedical informatics in [7]; and the approaches used in several German universities to implement bioinformatics education are described in [8]. Several approaches to providing bioinformatics training for biologists are described in the literature. Tan et al. [9] report on workshops conducted to identify a minimum skill set for biologists to be able to address the informatics challenges of the \textquotedblleft-omics\textquotedblright era. They define a requisite skill set by analyzing responses to questions about the knowledge, skills, and abilities that biologists should possess. The authors in [10] present examples of strategies and methods for incorporating bioinformatics content into undergraduate life sciences curricula. Pevzner and Shamir [11] propose that undergraduate biology curricula should contain an additional course, {\textquotedblleftAlgorithmic}, Mathematical, and Statistical Concepts in Biology.\textquotedblright Wingren and Botstein [12] present a graduate course in quantitative biology that is based on original, pathbreaking papers in diverse areas of biology. Johnson and Friedman [13] evaluate the effectiveness of incorporating biological informatics into a clinical informatics program. The results reported are based on interviews of four students and informal assessments of bioinformatics faculty. The challenges and opportunities relevant to training and education in the context of bioinformatics core facilities are discussed by Lewitter et al. [14]. Relatedly, Lewitter and Rebhan [15] provide guidance regarding the role of a bioinformatics core facility in hiring biologists and in furthering their education in bioinformatics. Richter and Sexton [16] describe a need for highly trained bioinformaticians in core facilities and provide a list of requisite skills. Similarly, Kallioniemi et al. [17] highlight the roles of bioinformatics core units in education and training. This manuscript expands the body of knowledge pertaining to bioinformatics curriculum guidelines by presenting the results from a broad set of surveys (of core facility directors, of career opportunities, and of existing curricula). Although there is some overlap in the findings of the surveys, they are reported separately, in order to avoid masking the unique aspects of each of the perspectives and to demonstrate that the same themes arise, even when different perspectives are considered. The authors derive from their surveys an initial set of core competencies and relate the competencies to three different categories of professions that have a need for bioinformatics training.}

When 50-100 cells of this phenotype are injected into an irradiated animal, they can permanently repopulate the entire hematopoietic system. In the present study, limiting-dilution and single-cell experiments were used to address the question of how individual Thy-{1loLin}-Sca-1+ stem cells contribute to repopulation of the hematopoietic system following irradiation. We calculated that 1 of 13 Thy-{1loLin}-Sca-1+ cells formed a clone comprising greater than 1\% of peripheral white blood cells 3-7 weeks after injection. The majority of these clones included both lymphoid and myeloid lineages. Approximately one-third of the clones continued to produce new blood cells for 9 weeks or more, but the remainder disappeared earlier, including many that were multilineage. Thus, while the majority of Thy-{1loLin}-Sca-1+ bone marrow cells whose progeny are detected in the in vivo repopulation assay are pluripotential, only a subset undergo long-term self-renewal in vivo. Repopulation appears to be oligoclonal when limiting numbers of Thy-{1loLin}-Sca-1+ cells are injected. However, the number of clones contributing to hematopoiesis increases in proportion to the number of Thy-{1loLin}-Sca-1+ cells injected, bringing into question the notion that steady-state hematopoiesis in normal individuals is oligoclonal.}

abstract = {Enhancers control the correct temporal and cell-type-specific activation of gene expression in multicellular eukaryotes. Knowing their properties, regulatory activity and targets is crucial to understand the regulation of differentiation and homeostasis. Here we use the {FANTOM5} panel of samples, covering the majority of human tissues and cell types, to produce an atlas of active, in vivo-transcribed enhancers. We show that enhancers share properties with {CpG}-poor messenger {RNA} promoters but produce bidirectional, exosome-sensitive, relatively short unspliced {RNAs}, the generation of which is strongly related to enhancer activity. The atlas is used to compare regulatory programs between different cells at unprecedented depth, to identify disease-associated regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms, and to classify cell-type-specific and ubiquitous enhancers. We further explore the utility of enhancer redundancy, which explains gene expression strength rather than expression patterns. The online {FANTOM5} enhancer atlas represents a unique resource for studies on cell-type-specific enhancers and gene regulation.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The image of the "epigenetic landscape", with a series of branching valleys and ridges depicting stable cellular states and the barriers between those states, has been a popular visual metaphor for cell lineage specification - especially in light of the recent discovery that terminally differentiated adult cells can be reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells or into alternative cell lineages. However the question of whether the epigenetic landscape can be mapped out quantitatively to provide a predictive model of cellular differentiation remains largely unanswered. {RESULTS}: Here we derive a simple deterministic path-integral quasi-potential, based on the kinetic parameters of a gene network regulating cell fate, and show that this quantity is minimized along a temporal trajectory in the state space of the gene network, thus providing a marker of directionality for cell differentiation processes. We then use the derived quasi-potential as a measure of "elevation" to quantitatively map the epigenetic landscape, on which trajectories flow "downhill" from any location. Stochastic simulations confirm that the elevation of this computed landscape correlates to the likelihood of occurrence of particular cell fates, with well-populated low-lying "valleys" representing stable cellular states and higher "ridges" acting as barriers to transitions between the stable states. {CONCLUSIONS}: This quantitative map of the epigenetic landscape underlying cell fate choice provides mechanistic insights into the "forces" that direct cellular differentiation in the context of physiological development, as well as during artificially induced cell lineage reprogramming. Our generalized approach to mapping the landscape is applicable to non-gradient gene regulatory systems for which an analytical potential function cannot be derived, and also to high-dimensional gene networks. Rigorous quantification of the gene regulatory circuits that govern cell lineage choice and subsequent mapping of the epigenetic landscape can potentially help identify optimal routes of cell fate reprogramming.}

abstract = {{DNA} methylation is an essential epigenetic mark whose role in gene regulation and its dependency on genomic sequence and environment are not fully understood. In this study we provide novel insights into the mechanistic relationships between genetic variation, {DNA} methylation and transcriptome sequencing data in three different cell-types of the {GenCord} human population cohort. We find that the association between {DNA} methylation and gene expression variation among individuals are likely due to different mechanisms from those establishing methylation-expression patterns during differentiation. Furthermore, cell-type differential {DNA} methylation may delineate a platform in which local inter-individual changes may respond to or act in gene regulation. We show that unlike genetic regulatory variation, {DNA} methylation alone does not significantly drive allele specific expression. Finally, inferred mechanistic relationships using genetic variation as well as correlations with {TF} abundance reveal both a passive and active role of {DNA} methylation to regulatory interactions influencing gene expression. {DOI}:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/{eLife}.00523.001.}

abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: A gene set test is a differential expression analysis in which a P-value is assigned to a set of genes as a unit. Gene set tests are valuable for increasing statistical power, organizing and interpreting results and for relating expression patterns across different experiments. Existing methods are based on permutation. Methods that rely on permutation of probes unrealistically assume independence of genes, while those that rely on permutation of sample are suitable only for two-group comparisons with a good number of replicates in each group. {RESULTS}: We present {ROAST}, a statistically rigorous gene set test that allows for gene-wise correlation while being applicable to almost any experimental design. Instead of permutation, {ROAST} uses rotation, a Monte Carlo technology for multivariate regression. Since the number of rotations does not depend on sample size, {ROAST} gives useful results even for experiments with minimal replication. {ROAST} allows for any experimental design that can be expressed as a linear model, and can also incorporate array weights and correlated samples. {ROAST} can be tuned for situations in which only a subset of the genes in the set are actively involved in the molecular pathway. {ROAST} can test for uni- or bi-direction regulation. Probes can also be weighted to allow for prior importance. The power and size of the {ROAST} procedure is demonstrated in a simulation study, and compared to that of a representative permutation method. Finally, {ROAST} is used to test the degree of transcriptional conservation between human and mouse mammary stems. {AVAILABILITY}: {ROAST} is implemented as a function in the Bioconductor package limma available from www.bioconductor.org.}

abstract = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput {PCR} data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of {RNA} sequencing ({RNA}-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for {RNA}-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both {RNA}-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described. \copyright The Author(s) 2015.

All the five {miRNAs} were validated on the plasma of 25 patients with {CRC} and 20 healthy controls. Both {miR}-17-3p and {miR}-92 were significantly elevated in the patients with {CRC} (p\textless0.0005). The plasma levels of these markers were significantly reduced after surgery in 10 patients with {CRC} (p\textless0.05). Further validation with an independent set of plasma samples (n = 180) indicated that {miR}-92 differentiates {CRC} from gastric cancer, {IBD} and normal subjects. This marker yielded a receiver operating characteristic curve area of 88.5\%. At a cut-off of 240 (relative expression in comparison to {RNU6B} {snRNA}), the sensitivity was 89\% and the specificity was 70\% in discriminating {CRC} from control subjects. {CONCLUSION}: {MiR}-92 is significantly elevated in plasma of patients with {CRC} and can be a potential non-invasive molecular marker for {CRC} screening.}

These represent {CpG}-poor distal regulatory regions as evidenced by location, {DNase} I hypersensitivity, presence of enhancer chromatin marks and enhancer activity in reporter assays. {LMRs} are occupied by {DNA}-binding factors and their binding is necessary and sufficient to create {LMRs}. A comparison of neuronal and stem-cell methylomes confirms this dependency, as cell-type-specific {LMRs} are occupied by cell-type-specific transcription factors.

It has been demonstrated during the past decade that the posttranslational modifications of histone proteins within the chromosome impact chromatin structure, gene transcription, and epigenetic information. Multiple modifications decorate each histone tail within the nucleosome, including some amino acids that can be modified in several different ways. Covalent modifications of histone tails known thus far include acetylation, phosphorylation, sumoylation, ubiquitination, and methylation. A large body of experimental evidence compiled during the past several years has demonstrated the impact of histone acetylation on transcriptional control. Although histone modification by methylation and ubiquitination was discovered long ago, it was only recently that functional roles for these modifications in transcriptional regulation began to surface. Highlighted in this review are the recent biochemical, molecular, cellular, and physiological functions of histone methylation and ubiquitination involved in the regulation of gene expression as determined by a combination of enzymological, structural, and genetic methodologies.}

Chromatin modifications are major carriers of epigenetic information that both reflect and affect the transcriptional states of underlying genes. Several histone modifications are key players that are responsible for classical epigenetic phenomena. However, the mechanisms by which cells pass their histone modifications to daughter cells through mitotic division remain to be unveiled. Here, we review recent progress in the field and conclude that epigenetic modifications are not precisely maintained at a near-mononucleosome level of precision. We also suggest that transcription repression may be maintained by a buffer system that can tolerate a certain degree of fluctuation in repressive histone modification levels. This buffer system protects the repressed genes from potential improper derepression triggered by chromatin modification-level fluctuation resulting from cellular events, such as the cell-cycle-dependent dilution of the chromatin modifications and local responses to environmental cues.}

abstract = {Transcription factors are adaptor molecules that detect regulatory sequences in the {DNA} and target the assembly of protein complexes that control gene expression. Yet much of the {DNA} in the eukaryotic cell is in nucleosomes and thereby occluded by histones, and can be further occluded by higher-order chromatin structures and repressor complexes. Indeed, genome-wide location analyses have revealed that, for all transcription factors tested, the vast majority of potential {DNA}-binding sites are unoccupied, demonstrating the inaccessibility of most of the nuclear {DNA}. This raises the question of how target sites at silent genes become bound de novo by transcription factors, thereby initiating regulatory events in chromatin. Binding cooperativity can be sufficient for many kinds of factors to simultaneously engage a target site in chromatin and activate gene expression. However, in cases in which the binding of a series of factors is sequential in time and thus not initially cooperative, special "pioneer transcription factors" can be the first to engage target sites in chromatin. Such initial binding can passively enhance transcription by reducing the number of additional factors that are needed to bind the {DNA}, culminating in activation. In addition, pioneer factor binding can actively open up the local chromatin and directly make it competent for other factors to bind. Passive and active roles for the pioneer factor {FoxA} occur in embryonic development, steroid hormone induction, and human cancers. Herein we review the field and describe how pioneer factors may enable cellular reprogramming.}

abstract = {Epigenetic marking systems confer stability of gene expression during mammalian development. Genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming occurs at stages when developmental potency of cells changes. At fertilization, the paternal genome exchanges protamines for histones, undergoes {DNA} demethylation, and acquires histone modifications, whereas the maternal genome appears epigenetically more static. During preimplantation development, there is passive {DNA} demethylation and further reorganization of histone modifications. In blastocysts, embryonic and extraembryonic lineages first show different epigenetic marks. This epigenetic reprogramming is likely to be needed for totipotency, correct initiation of embryonic gene expression, and early lineage development in the embryo. Comparative work demonstrates reprogramming in all mammalian species analysed, but the extent and timing varies, consistent with notable differences between species during preimplantation development. Parental imprinting marks originate in sperm and oocytes and are generally protected from this genome-wide reprogramming. Early primordial germ cells possess imprinting marks similar to those of somatic cells. However, rapid {DNA} demethylation after midgestation erases these parental imprints, in preparation for sex-specific de novo methylation during gametogenesis. Aberrant reprogramming of somatic epigenetic marks after somatic cell nuclear transfer leads to epigenetic defects in cloned embryos and stem cells. Links between epigenetic marking systems appear to be developmentally regulated contributing to plasticity. A number of activities that confer epigenetic marks are firmly established, while for those that remove marks, particularly methylation, some interesting candidates have emerged recently which need thorough testing in vivo. A mechanistic understanding of reprogramming will be crucial for medical applications of stem cell technology.}

Although several factors important for these processes have been identified, the fundamental mechanisms regulating {\SSC} self-renewal and differentiation remain unknown. Here, we investigated a role for the Foxo transcription factors in mouse spermatogenesis and found that Foxo1 specifically marks mouse gonocytes and a subset of spermatogonia with stem cell potential. Genetic analyses showed that Foxo1 was required for both {\SSC} homeostasis and the initiation of spermatogenesis. Combined deficiency of Foxo1, Foxo3, and Foxo4 resulted in a severe impairment of {\SSC} self-renewal and a complete block of differentiation, indicating that Foxo3 and Foxo4, although dispensable for male fertility, contribute to {\SSC} function. By conditional inactivation of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (Pdk1) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) in the male germ line, we found that {PI3K} signaling regulates Foxo1 stability and subcellular localization, revealing that the Foxos are pivotal effectors of {PI3K}-Akt signaling in {\SSCs}. We also identified a network of Foxo gene targets--most notably Ret--that rationalized the maintenance of {\SSCs} by the Foxos. These studies demonstrate that Foxo1 expression in the spermatogenic lineage is intimately associated with the stem cell state and revealed what we believe to be novel Foxo-dependent mechanisms underlying {\SSC} self-renewal and differentiation, with implications for common diseases, including male infertility and testicular cancer, due to abnormalities in {\SSC} function.}

Comparison of the lin-4 genomic sequence from these four species and site-directed mutagenesis of potential open reading frames indicated that lin-4 does not encode a protein. Two small lin-4 transcripts of approximately 22 and 61 nt were identified in C. elegans and found to contain sequences complementary to a repeated sequence element in the 3' untranslated region ({UTR}) of lin-14 {mRNA}, suggesting that lin-4 regulates lin-14 translation via an antisense {RNA}-{RNA} interaction.}

In embryonic pluripotent stem cells, these epigenetic modifications have been extensively characterized; by contrast, the epigenetic events of tissue-specific stem cells are poorly understood. Here, we define a new epigenetic shift that is crucial for differentiation of murine spermatogonia toward meiosis. We have exploited a property of incomplete cytokinesis, which causes male germ cells to form aligned chains of characteristic lengths, as they divide and differentiate. These chains revealed the stage of spermatogenesis, so the epigenetic differences of various stages could be characterized. Single, paired and medium chain-length spermatogonia not expressing Kit (a marker of differentiating spermatogonia) showed no expression of Dnmt3a2 and Dnmt3b (two de novo {DNA} methyltransferases); they also lacked the transcriptionally repressive histone modification {H3K9me2}. By contrast, spermatogonia consisting of \~8-16 chained cells with Kit expression dramatically upregulated Dnmt3a2/3b expression and also displayed increased {H3K9me2} modification. To explore the function of these epigenetic changes in spermatogonia in vivo, the {DNA} methylation machinery was destabilized by ectopic Dnmt3b expression or Np95 ablation. Forced Dnmt3b expression induced expression of Kit; whereas ablation of Np95, which is essential for maintaining {DNA} methylation, interfered with differentiation and viability only after spermatogonia become Kit positive. These data suggest that the epigenetic status of spermatogonia shifts dramatically during the Kit-negative to Kit-positive transition. This shift might serve as a switch that determines whether spermatogonia self-renew or differentiate.}

It divides the seminiferous epithelium into the basal and the apical (adluminal) compartments. Meiosis I and {II}, spermiogenesis, and spermiation all take place in a specialized microenvironment behind the {BTB} in the apical compartment, but spermatogonial renewal and differentiation and cell cycle progression up to the preleptotene spermatocyte stage take place outside of the {BTB} in the basal compartment of the epithelium. However, the {BTB} is not a static ultrastructure. Instead, it undergoes extensive restructuring during the seminiferous epithelial cycle of spermatogenesis at stage {VIII} to allow the transit of preleptotene spermatocytes at the {BTB}. Yet the immunological barrier conferred by the {BTB} cannot be compromised, even transiently, during the epithelial cycle to avoid the production of antibodies against meiotic and postmeiotic germ cells. Studies have demonstrated that some unlikely partners, namely adhesion protein complexes (e.g., occludin-{ZO}-1, N-cadherin-\beta-catenin, claudin-5-{ZO}-1), steroids (e.g., testosterone, estradiol-17\beta), nonreceptor protein kinases (e.g., focal adhesion kinase, c-Src, c-Yes), polarity proteins (e.g., {PAR6}, Cdc42, 14-3-3), endocytic vesicle proteins (e.g., clathrin, caveolin, dynamin 2), and actin regulatory proteins (e.g., Eps8, Arp2/3 complex), are working together, apparently under the overall influence of cytokines (e.g., transforming growth factor-\beta3, tumor necrosis factor-\alpha, interleukin-1\alpha). In short, a "new" {BTB} is created behind spermatocytes in transit while the "old" {BTB} above transiting cells undergoes timely degeneration, so that the immunological barrier can be maintained while spermatocytes are traversing the {BTB}. We also discuss recent findings regarding the molecular mechanisms by which environmental toxicants (e.g., cadmium, bisphenol A) induce testicular injury via their initial actions at the {BTB} to elicit subsequent damage to germ-cell adhesion, thereby leading to germ-cell loss, reduced sperm count, and male infertility or subfertility. Moreover, we also critically evaluate findings in the field regarding studies on drug transporters in the testis and discuss how these influx and efflux pumps regulate the entry of potential nonhormonal male contraceptives to the apical compartment to exert their effects. Collectively, these findings illustrate multiple potential targets are present at the {BTB} for innovative contraceptive development and for better delivery of drugs to alleviate toxicant-induced reproductive dysfunction in men.}

Because epigenetic states are metastable and change in response to the appropriate signals, a deeper understanding of their molecular framework will allow us to tackle the dysregulation of epigenetics in disease.}

abstract = {Small {RNAs} associated with post-transcriptional gene silencing were first discovered in plants in 1999. Although this study marked the beginning of small {RNA} biology in plants, the sequence of the Arabidopsis genome and related genomic resources that were soon to become available to the Arabidopsis community launched the research on small {RNAs} at a remarkable pace. In 2000, when the genetic blueprint of the first plant species was revealed, the tens of thousands of endogenous small {RNA} species as we know today remained hidden features of the genome. However, the subsequent 10 years have witnessed an explosion of our knowledge of endogenous small {RNAs}: their widespread existence, diversity, biogenesis, mode of action and biological functions. As key sequence-specific regulators of gene expression in the nucleus and the cytoplasm, small {RNAs} influence almost all aspects of plant biology. Because of the extensive conservation of mechanisms concerning the biogenesis and molecular actions of small {RNAs}, research in the model plant Arabidopsis has contributed vital knowledge to the small {RNA} field in general. Our knowledge of small {RNAs} gained primarily from Arabidopsis has also led to the invention of effective gene knock-down technologies that are applicable to diverse plant species, including crop plants. Here, I attempt to recount the developments of the small {RNA} field in the pre- and post-genomic era, in celebration of the 10th anniversary of the completion of the first plant genome.}

In addition, I will show that (ii) there exist as yet unrecognized heuristic roles, especially in model building and theory formation, which Waddington's images play within his work. These different methodological facets envisioned by Waddington are used as a natural framework to analyze and classify the manners of usage of epigenetic landscape images in post-Waddingtonian 'landscape approaches'. This evaluation of Waddington's pictorial legacy reveals that there are highly diverse lines of traditions in the life sciences, which are deeply rooted in Waddington's methodological work.

We first provide an overview of what is known about androgen action in this tissue and then present data on the initial and sequential roles of androgens in altering cellular architecture and function in an androgen-deprived condition. Using morphometric analysis and the rat model, we identified changes in epithelial cell height and lumen diameter, as well as in the numbers of proliferating cells in different regions and at various time points after androgen withdrawal and replacement. The sequence of gene activation or suppression that occurred in the androgen-deprived tissue was examined upon the readministration of the 2 active metabolites of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone ({DHT}) and estradiol. Although few genes were regulated by estradiol, many were affected by {DHT}. Epidermal growth factor ({EGF}) and insulinlike growth factor-1 ({IGF1}) appear to play an important role in the early response pathway activated by {DHT} because of their function in the regulation of the expression of many other genes. The intracellular signaling pathway involved in mediating the action of androgen in restoring epididymal epithelial cell integrity was investigated using the {PC}-1 epididymal cell line. {IGF1} and {EGF} receptors were found to be important mediators of androgen receptor-mediated activation of the {MAPK}/{ERK} pathways.

We suggest that the conserved colocalization of different epigenomic marks can be used to discover regulatory sequences. Indeed, seven pairs of epigenomic marks identified exhibited regulatory functions during differentiation of embryonic stem cells into mesendoderm cells.

We show that failing to incorporate these sources of heterogeneity into an analysis can have widespread and detrimental effects on the study. Not only can this reduce power or induce unwanted dependence across genes, but it can also introduce sources of spurious signal to many genes. This phenomenon is true even for well-designed, randomized studies. We introduce "surrogate variable analysis" ({SVA}) to overcome the problems caused by heterogeneity in expression studies. {SVA} can be applied in conjunction with standard analysis techniques to accurately capture the relationship between expression and any modeled variables of interest.

We report a genomic sequencing method that provides positive identification of 5-methylcytosine residues and yields strand-specific sequences of individual molecules in genomic {DNA}. The method utilizes bisulfite-induced modification of genomic {DNA}, under conditions whereby cytosine is converted to uracil, but 5-methylcytosine remains nonreactive. The sequence under investigation is then amplified by {PCR} with two sets of strand-specific primers to yield a pair of fragments, one from each strand, in which all uracil and thymine residues have been amplified as thymine and only 5-methylcytosine residues have been amplified as cytosine. The {PCR} products can be sequenced directly to provide a strand-specific average sequence for the population of molecules or can be cloned and sequenced to provide methylation maps of single {DNA} molecules. We tested the method by defining the methylation status within single {DNA} strands of two closely spaced {CpG} dinucleotides in the promoter of the human kininogen gene. During the analysis, we encountered in sperm {DNA} an unusual methylation pattern, which suggests that the high methylation level of single-copy sequences in sperm may be locally modulated by binding of protein factors in germ-line cells.}

abstract = {{DNA} methylation is a major epigenetic modification of the genome that regulates crucial aspects of its function. Genomic methylation patterns in somatic differentiated cells are generally stable and heritable. However, in mammals there are at least two developmental periods-in germ cells and in preimplantation embryos-in which methylation patterns are reprogrammed genome wide, generating cells with a broad developmental potential. Epigenetic reprogramming in germ cells is critical for imprinting; reprogramming in early embryos also affects imprinting. Reprogramming is likely to have a crucial role in establishing nuclear totipotency in normal development and in cloned animals, and in the erasure of acquired epigenetic information. A role of reprogramming in stem cell differentiation is also envisaged. {DNA} methylation is one of the best-studied epigenetic modifications of {DNA} in all unicellular and multicellular organisms. In mammals and other vertebrates, methylation occurs predominantly at the symmetrical dinucleotide {CpG} (1-4). Symmetrical methylation and the discovery of a {DNA} methyltransferase that prefers a hemimethylated substrate, Dnmt1 (4), suggested a mechanism by which specific patterns of methylation in the genome could be maintained. Patterns imposed on the genome at defined developmental time points in precursor cells could be maintained by Dnmt1, and would lead to predetermined programs of gene expression during development in descendants of the precursor cells (5, 6). This provided a means to explain how patterns of differentiation could be maintained by populations of cells. In addition, specific demethylation events in differentiated tissues could then lead to further changes in gene expression as needed. Neat and convincing as this model is, it is still largely unsubstantiated. While effects of methylation on expression of specific genes, particularly imprinted ones (7) and some retrotransposons (8), have been demonstrated in vivo, it is still unclear whether or not methylation is involved in the control of gene expression during normal development (9-13). Although enzymes have been identified that can methylate {DNA} de novo (Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b) (14), it is unknown how specific patterns of methylation are established in the genome. Mechanisms for active demethylation have been suggested, but no enzymes have been identified that carry out this function in vivo (15-17). Genomewide alterations in methylation-brought about, for example, by knockouts of the methylase genes-result in embryo lethality or developmental defects, but the basis for abnormal development still remains to be discovered (7, 14). What is clear, however, is that in mammals there are developmental periods of genomewide reprogramming of methylation patterns in vivo. Typically, a substantial part of the genome is demethylated, and after some time remethylated, in a cell- or tissue-specific pattern. The developmental dynamics of these reprogramming events, as well as some of the enzymatic mechanisms involved and the biological purposes, are beginning to be understood. Here we look at what is known about reprogramming in mammals and discuss how it might relate to developmental potency and imprinting.}

abstract = {Organisms often respond to environmental changes by producing alternative phenotypes. Epigenetic processes such as {DNA} methylation may contribute to environmentally induced phenotypic variation by modifying gene expression. Changes in {DNA} methylation, unlike {DNA} mutations, can be influenced by the environment; they are stable at the time scale of an individual and present different levels of heritability. These characteristics make {DNA} methylation a potentially important molecular process to respond to environmental change. The aim of this review is to present the implications of {DNA} methylation on phenotypic variations driven by environmental changes. More specifically, we explore epigenetic concepts concerning phenotypic change in response to the environment and heritability of {DNA} methylation, namely the Baldwin effect and genetic accommodation. Before addressing this point, we report major differences in {DNA} methylation across taxa and the role of this modification in producing and maintaining environmentally induced phenotypic variation. We also present the different methods allowing the detection of methylation polymorphism. We believe this review will be helpful to molecular ecologists, in that it highlights the importance of epigenetic processes in ecological and evolutionary studies.}

One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. {edgeR} is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data. {AVAILABILITY}: The package is freely available under the {LGPL} licence from the Bioconductor web site (http://bioconductor.org).}

Such disorders can persist through adulthood and have often been reported to be transmitted across generations. {METHODS}: To investigate the transgenerational effect of early stress, mice were exposed to chronic and unpredictable maternal separation from postnatal day 1 to 14. {RESULTS}: We show that chronic and unpredictable maternal separation induces depressive-like behaviors and alters the behavioral response to aversive environments in the separated animals when adult. Most of the behavioral alterations are further expressed by the offspring of males subjected to maternal separation, despite the fact that these males are reared normally. Chronic and unpredictable maternal separation also alters the profile of {DNA} methylation in the promoter of several candidate genes in the germline of the separated males. Comparable changes in {DNA} methylation are also present in the brain of the offspring and are associated with altered gene expression. {CONCLUSIONS}: These findings highlight the negative impact of early stress on behavioral responses across generations and on the regulation of {DNA} methylation in the germline.

Currently, {CpG} islands are defined based on their genomic sequences alone. Here, we develop evolutionary models to show that several distinct evolutionary processes generate and maintain {CpG} islands. One central evolutionary regime resulting in enriched {CpG} content is driven by low levels of {DNA} methylation and consequentially low rates of {CpG} deamination. Another major force forming {CpG} islands is biased gene conversion that stabilizes constitutively methylated {CpG} islands by balancing rapid deamination with {CpG} fixation. Importantly, evolutionary analysis and population genetics data suggest that selection for high {CpG} content is not a significant factor contributing to conservation of {CpGs} in differentially methylated regions. The heterogeneous, but not selective, origins of {CpG} islands have direct implications for the understanding of {DNA} methylation patterns in healthy and diseased cells.

Here we reveal the molecular logic underlying the retention of nucleosomes in mouse spermatozoa, which contain only 1\% residual histones. We observe high enrichment throughout the genome of nucleosomes at {CpG}-rich sequences that lack {DNA} methylation. Residual nucleosomes are largely composed of the histone H3.3 variant and are trimethylated at Lys4 of histone H3 ({H3K4me3}). Canonical H3.1 and H3.2 histones are also enriched at {CpG}-rich promoters marked by Polycomb-mediated {H3K27me3}, a modification predictive of gene repression in preimplantation embryos. Histone variant-specific nucleosome retention in sperm is strongly associated with nucleosome turnover in round spermatids. Our data show evolutionary conservation of the basic principles of nucleosome retention in mouse and human sperm, supporting a model of epigenetic inheritance by nucleosomes between generations.}

Epigenetics is the study of nonsequence-based changes, such as {DNA} methylation, heritable during cell division. Previous attempts to incorporate epigenetics into evolutionary thinking have focused on Lamarckian inheritance, that is, environmentally directed epigenetic changes. Here, we propose a new non-Lamarckian theory for a role of epigenetics in evolution. We suggest that genetic variants that do not change the mean phenotype could change the variability of phenotype; and this could be mediated epigenetically. This inherited stochastic variation model would provide a mechanism to explain an epigenetic role of developmental biology in selectable phenotypic variation, as well as the largely unexplained heritable genetic variation underlying common complex disease. We provide two experimental results as proof of principle. The first result is direct evidence for stochastic epigenetic variation, identifying highly variably {DNA}-methylated regions in mouse and human liver and mouse brain, associated with development and morphogenesis. The second is a heritable genetic mechanism for variable methylation, namely the loss or gain of {CpG} dinucleotides over evolutionary time. Finally, we model genetically inherited stochastic variation in evolution, showing that it provides a powerful mechanism for evolutionary adaptation in changing environments that can be mediated epigenetically. These data suggest that genetically inherited propensity to phenotypic variability, even with no change in the mean phenotype, substantially increases fitness while increasing the disease susceptibility of a population with a changing environment.}

During development, the pattern of {DNA} methylation in the genome changes as a result of a dynamic process involving both de novo {DNA} methylation and demethylation. As a consequence, differentiated cells develop a stable and unique {DNA} methylation pattern that regulates tissue-specific gene transcription. In this chapter, we will review the process of {DNA} methylation and demethylation in the nervous system. We will describe the {DNA} (de)methylation machinery and its association with other epigenetic mechanisms such as histone modifications and noncoding {RNAs}. Intriguingly, postmitotic neurons still express {DNA} methyltransferases and components involved in {DNA} demethylation. Moreover, neuronal activity can modulate their pattern of {DNA} methylation in response to physiological and environmental stimuli. The precise regulation of {DNA} methylation is essential for normal cognitive function. Indeed, when {DNA} methylation is altered as a result of developmental mutations or environmental risk factors, such as drug exposure and neural injury, mental impairment is a common side effect. The investigation into {DNA} methylation continues to show a rich and complex picture about epigenetic gene regulation in the central nervous system and provides possible therapeutic targets for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.}

However, algorithms that enable the analysis of alternative splicing from short-read sequencing are not fully established yet and there are still no standard solutions available for a variety of data analysis tasks. {RESULTS}: We present a new method and software to predict genes that are differentially spliced between two different conditions using {RNA}-seq data. Our method uses geometric angles between the high dimensional vectors of exon read counts. With this, differential splicing can be detected even if the splicing events are composed of higher complexity and involve previously unknown splicing patterns. We applied our approach to two case studies including neuroblastoma tumour data with favourable and unfavourable clinical courses. We show the validity of our predictions as well as the applicability of our method in the context of patient clustering. We verified our predictions by several methods including simulated experiments and complementary in silico analyses. We found a significant number of exons with specific regulatory splicing factor motifs for predicted genes and a substantial number of publications linking those genes to alternative splicing. Furthermore, we could successfully exploit splicing information to cluster tissues and patients. Finally, we found additional evidence of splicing diversity for many predicted genes in normalized read coverage plots and in reads that span exon-exon junctions. {AVAILABILITY}: {SplicingCompass} is licensed under the {GNU} {GPL} and freely available as a package in the statistical language R at http://www.ichip.de/software/{SplicingCompass}.html}

abstract = {The ability to measure gene expression on a genome-wide scale is one of the most promising accomplishments in molecular biology. Microarrays, the technology that first permitted this, were riddled with problems due to unwanted sources of variability. Many of these problems are now mitigated, after a decade's worth of statistical methodology development. The recently developed {RNA} sequencing ({RNA}-seq) technology has generated much excitement in part due to claims of reduced variability in comparison to microarrays. However, we show that {RNA}-seq data demonstrate unwanted and obscuring variability similar to what was first observed in microarrays. In particular, we find guanine-cytosine content ({GC}-content) has a strong sample-specific effect on gene expression measurements that, if left uncorrected, leads to false positives in downstream results. We also report on commonly observed data distortions that demonstrate the need for data normalization. Here, we describe a statistical methodology that improves precision by 42\% without loss of accuracy. Our resulting conditional quantile normalization algorithm combines robust generalized regression to remove systematic bias introduced by deterministic features such as {GC}-content and quantile normalization to correct for global distortions.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: {LINE}-1 (L1) is the dominant category of transposable elements in placental mammals. L1 has significantly affected the size and structure of all mammalian genomes and understanding the nature of the interactions between L1 and its mammalian host remains a question of crucial importance in comparative genomics. For this reason, much attention has been dedicated to the evolution of L1. Among the most studied elements is the mouse L1 which has been the subject of a number of studies in the 1980s and 1990s. These seminal studies, performed in the pre-genomic era when only a limited number of L1 sequences were available, have significantly improved our understanding of L1 evolution. Yet, no comprehensive study on the evolution of L1 in mouse has been performed since the completion of this genome sequence. {RESULTS}: Using the Genome Parsing Suite we performed the first evolutionary analysis of mouse L1 over the entire length of the element. This analysis indicates that the mouse L1 has recruited novel 5'{UTR} sequences more frequently than previously thought and that the simultaneous activity of non-homologous promoters seems to be one of the conditions for the co-existence of multiple L1 families or lineages. In addition the exchange of genetic information between L1 families is not limited to the 5'{UTR} as evidence of inter-family recombination was observed in {ORF1}, {ORF2}, and the 3'{UTR}. In contrast to the human L1, there was little evidence of rapid amino-acid replacement in the coiled-coil of {ORF1}, although this region is structurally unstable. We propose that the structural instability of the coiled-coil domain might be adaptive and that structural changes in this region are selectively equivalent to the rapid evolution at the amino-acid level reported in the human lineage. {CONCLUSIONS}: The pattern of evolution of L1 in mouse shows some similarity with human suggesting that the nature of the interactions between L1 and its host might be similar in these two species. Yet, some notable differences, particularly in the evolution of {ORF1}, suggest that the molecular mechanisms involved in host-L1 interactions might be different in these two species.}

These sources of noise must be modeled and removed to accurately measure biological variability and to obtain correct statistical inference when performing high-throughput genomic analysis. We introduced surrogate variable analysis (sva) for estimating these artifacts by (i) identifying the part of the genomic data only affected by artifacts and (ii) estimating the artifacts with principal components or singular vectors of the subset of the data matrix. The resulting estimates of artifacts can be used in subsequent analyses as adjustment factors to correct analyses. Here I describe a version of the sva approach specifically created for count data or {FPKMs} from sequencing experiments based on appropriate data transformation. I also describe the addition of supervised sva (ssva) for using control probes to identify the part of the genomic data only affected by artifacts. I present a comparison between these versions of sva and other methods for batch effect estimation on simulated data, real count-based data and {FPKM}-based data.

abstract = {The evolutionary mechanisms underlying duplicate gene maintenance and divergence remain highly debated. Epigenetic modifications, such as {DNA} methylation, may contribute to duplicate gene evolution by facilitating tissue-specific regulation. However, the role of epigenetic divergence on duplicate gene evolution remains little understood. Here we show, using comprehensive data across 10 diverse human tissues, that {DNA} methylation plays critical roles in several aspects of duplicate gene evolution. We first demonstrate that duplicate genes are initially heavily methylated, before gradually losing {DNA} methylation as they age. Within each pair, {DNA} methylation divergence between duplicate partners increases with evolutionary age. Importantly, tissue-specific {DNA} methylation of duplicates correlates with tissue-specific expression, implicating {DNA} methylation as a causative factor for functional divergence of duplicate genes. These patterns are apparent in promoters but not in gene bodies, in accord with the complex relationship between gene-body {DNA} methylation and transcription. Remarkably, many duplicate gene pairs exhibit consistent division of {DNA} methylation across multiple, divergent tissues: For the majority (73\%) of duplicate gene pairs, one partner is always hypermethylated compared with the other. This is indicative of a common underlying determinant of {DNA} methylation. The division of {DNA} methylation is also consistent with their chromatin accessibility profiles. Moreover, at least two sequence motifs known to interact with the Sp1 transcription factor mark promoters of more hypomethylated duplicate partners. These results demonstrate critical roles of {DNA} methylation, as well as complex interaction between genome and epigenome, on duplicate gene evolution.}

We have extensively characterized imprinted methylation in a substantial range of normal human tissues, reciprocal genome-wide uniparental disomies, and hydatidiform moles, using a combination of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and high-density methylation microarrays. This approach allowed us to define methylation profiles at known imprinted domains at base-pair resolution, as well as to identify 21 novel loci harboring parent-of-origin methylation, 15 of which are restricted to the placenta. We observe that the extent of imprinted differentially methylated regions ({DMRs}) is extremely similar between tissues, with the exception of the placenta. This extra-embryonic tissue often adopts a different methylation profile compared to somatic tissues. Further, we profiled all imprinted {DMRs} in sperm and embryonic stem cells derived from parthenogenetically activated oocytes, individual blastomeres, and blastocysts, in order to identify primary {DMRs} and reveal the extent of reprogramming during preimplantation development. Intriguingly, we find that in contrast to ubiquitous imprints, the majority of placenta-specific imprinted {DMRs} are unmethylated in sperm and all human embryonic stem cells. Therefore, placental-specific imprinting provides evidence for an inheritable epigenetic state that is independent of {DNA} methylation and the existence of a novel imprinting mechanism at these loci.}

Noncoding {DNA}, containing introns, repetitive elements, and potentially active transposable elements, requires effective mechanisms for its long-term silencing. Mammals appear to have taken advantage of the possibilities afforded by cytosine methylation to provide a heritable mechanism for altering {DNA}-protein interactions to assist in such silencing. Genes can be transcribed from methylation-free promoters even though adjacent transcribed and nontranscribed regions are extensively methylated. Gene promoters can be used and regulated while keeping noncoding {DNA}, including transposable elements, suppressed. Methylation is also used for long-term epigenetic silencing of X-linked and imprinted genes and can either increase or decrease the level of transcription, depending on whether the methylation inactivates a positive or negative regulatory element.}

In addition, there are specific examples, both in mice and other animal species, where nonmutagenic, environmental insults to either parent, such as those caused by consumption of endocrine-disrupting chemicals, can cause unexpected transgenerational phenotypic changes in offspring. Animals derived by somatic cell nuclear transfer also frequently exhibit pathologies that can be linked to inappropriate nuclear reprogramming during early embryo development and provide another means to study a link between epigenetics and disease. This review will consider how all of these animal models might help elucidate the epigenetic basis for a wide range of phenotypes.}

As in mammals, the majority of Drosophila {piRNAs} are derived from discrete genomic loci. These loci comprise mainly defective transposon sequences, and some have previously been identified as master regulators of transposon activity. Our data suggest that heterochromatic {piRNA} loci interact with potentially active, euchromatic transposons to form an adaptive system for transposon control. Complementary relationships between sense and antisense {piRNA} populations suggest an amplification loop wherein each {piRNA}-directed cleavage event generates the 5' end of a new {piRNA}.

During early embryonic development, somatic cells give rise to a small population of cells known as germ cells, which eventually differentiate into mature gametes. Germ cells undergo a process of removing and resetting relevant epigenetic information, mainly by {DNA} demethylation. This extensive epigenetic reprogramming leads to the conversion of germ cells into immortal cells that can pass on the genome to the next generation. In the absence of germline-specific reprogramming, germ cells would preserve the old, parental epigenetic memory, which would prevent the transfer of heritable information to the offspring. On the contrary, somatic cells cannot reset epigenetic information by preserving the full methylation pattern on imprinting genes. In this review, we focus on the capacity of germ cells and somatic cells (soma) to transfer genetic information to the next generation, and thus revisit the Weismann theory of heredity.

The role that noncoding {RNAs} ({ncRNAs}) play as potent and specific regulators of gene expression is now widely recognized in almost all species studied to date. Long {ncRNAs} can both upregulate and downregulate gene expression in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes and are essential in processes such as dosage compensation, genomic imprinting, developmental patterning and differentiation, and stress response. Small {ncRNAs} also play essential roles in diverse organisms, although are limited to eukaryotes. Different small {RNA} classes regulate diverse processes such as transposon and virus suppression, as well as many key developmental processes.}

A long-standing hypothesis states that species-specific traits may be explained by differences in gene regulation rather than differences at the protein level. Over the past few years, evolutionary studies have shifted from mere sequence comparisons to integrative analyses in which gene regulation is key to understanding species evolution. {DNA} methylation is an important epigenetic modification involved in the regulation of numerous biological processes. Nevertheless, the evolution of the human methylome and the processes driving such changes are poorly understood. Here, we review the close interplay between Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine ({CpG}) methylation and the underlying genome sequence, as well as its evolutionary impact. We also summarize the latest advances in the field, revisiting the main literature on human and nonhuman primates. We hope to encourage the scientific community to address the many challenges posed by the field of comparative epigenomics.}

abstract = {Understanding the molecular basis of ageing remains a fundamental problem in biology. In multicellular organisms, while the soma undergoes a progressive deterioration over the lifespan, the germ line is essentially immortal as it interconnects the subsequent generations. Genomic instability in somatic cells increases with age, and accumulating evidence indicates that the disintegration of somatic genomes is accompanied by the mobilisation of transposable elements ({TEs}) that, when mobilised, can be mutagenic by disrupting coding or regulatory sequences. In contrast, {TEs} are effectively silenced in the germ line by the Piwi-{piRNA} system. Here, we propose that {TE} repression transmits the persistent proliferation capacity and the non-ageing phenotype (e.g., preservation of genomic integrity) of the germ line. The Piwi-{piRNA} pathway also operates in tumorous cells and in somatic cells of certain organisms, including hydras, which likewise exhibit immortality. However, in somatic cells lacking the Piwi-{piRNA} pathway, gradual chromatin decondensation increasingly allows the mobilisation of {TEs} as the organism ages. This can explain why the mortality rate rises exponentially throughout the adult life in most animal species, including humans.}

abstract = {{mRNA} is thought to predominantly reside in the cytoplasm, where it is translated and eventually degraded. Although nuclear retention of {mRNA} has a regulatory potential, it is considered extremely rare in mammals. Here, to explore the extent of {mRNA} retention in metabolic tissues, we combine deep sequencing of nuclear and cytoplasmic {RNA} fractions with single-molecule transcript imaging in mouse beta cells, liver, and gut. We identify a wide range of protein-coding genes for which the levels of spliced polyadenylated {mRNA} are higher in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm. These include genes such as the transcription factor {ChREBP}, Nlrp6, Glucokinase, and Glucagon receptor. We demonstrate that nuclear retention of {mRNA} can efficiently buffer cytoplasmic transcript levels from noise that emanates from transcriptional bursts. Our study challenges the view that transcripts predominantly reside in the cytoplasm and reveals a role of the nucleus in dampening gene expression noise. Copyright \copyright 2015 The Authors.

abstract = {{DNA} methylation is essential for protecting the mammalian germline against transposons. When {DNA} methylation-based transposon control is defective, meiotic chromosome pairing is consistently impaired during spermatogenesis: How and why meiosis is vulnerable to transposon activity is unknown. Using two {DNA} methylation-deficient backgrounds, the {Dnmt3L} and Miwi2 mutant mice, we reveal that {DNA} methylation is largely dispensable for silencing transposons before meiosis onset. After this, it becomes crucial to back up to a developmentally programmed {H3K9me2} loss. Massive retrotransposition does not occur following transposon derepression, but the meiotic chromatin landscape is profoundly affected. Indeed, {H3K4me3} marks gained over transcriptionally active transposons correlate with formation of {SPO11}-dependent double-strand breaks and recruitment of the {DMC1} repair enzyme in {Dnmt3L}(-/-) meiotic cells, whereas these features are normally exclusive to meiotic recombination hot spots. Here, we demonstrate that {DNA} methylation restrains transposons from adopting chromatin characteristics amenable to meiotic recombination, which we propose prevents the occurrence of erratic chromosomal events. \copyright 2015 Zamudio et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.}

Sequences are automatically cleaned, trimmed, size selected and mapped directly to {miRNA} hairpin sequences. This generates count-based {miRNA} expression data for subsequent statistical analysis. Moreover, it is capable of identifying epi-transcriptomic modifications in the input sequences. Supported modification types include multiple types of 3'-modifications (e.g. uridylation, adenylation), 5'-modifications and also internal modifications or variation ({ADAR} editing or single nucleotide polymorphisms). Besides cleaning and mapping of input sequences to {miRNAs}, Chimira provides a simple and intuitive set of tools for the analysis and interpretation of the results (see also Supplementary Material). These allow the visual study of the differential expression between two specific samples or sets of samples, the identification of the most highly expressed {miRNAs} within sample pairs (or sets of samples) and also the projection of the modification profile for specific {miRNAs} across all samples. Other tools have already been published in the past for various types of small {RNA}-Seq analysis, such as {UEA} workbench, {seqBuster}, {MAGI}, {OASIS} and {CAP}-{miRSeq}, {CP\SS} for modifications identification. A comprehensive comparison of Chimira with each of these tools is provided in the Supplementary Material.

Zfp145 expression was restricted to gonocytes and undifferentiated spermatogonia and was absent in tubules of W/W(v) mutants that lack these cells. Mice lacking Zfp145 underwent a progressive loss of spermatogonia with age, associated with increases in apoptosis and subsequent loss of tubule structure but without overt differentiation defects or loss of the supporting Sertoli cells. Spermatogonial transplantation experiments revealed a depletion of spermatogonial stem cells in the adult. Microarray analysis of isolated spermatogonia from Zfp145-null mice before testis degeneration showed alterations in the expression profile of genes associated with spermatogenesis. These results identify Plzf as a spermatogonia-specific transcription factor in the testis that is required to regulate self-renewal and maintenance of the stem cell pool.}

We use kallisto to analyze 30 million unaligned paired-end {RNA}-seq reads in \textless 10 min on a standard laptop computer. This removes a major computational bottleneck in {RNA}-seq analysis.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Previously, a role was demonstrated for transcription in the acquisition of {DNA} methylation at imprinted control regions in oocytes. Definition of the oocyte {DNA} methylome by whole genome approaches revealed that the majority of methylated {CpG} islands are intragenic and gene bodies are hypermethylated. Yet, the mechanisms by which transcription regulates {DNA} methylation in oocytes remain unclear. Here, we systematically test the link between transcription and the methylome. {RESULTS}: We perform deep {RNA}-Seq and de novo transcriptome assembly at different stages of mouse oogenesis. This reveals thousands of novel non-annotated genes, as well as alternative promoters, for approximately 10 \% of reference genes expressed in oocytes. In addition, a large fraction of novel promoters coincide with {MaLR} and {ERVK} transposable elements. Integration with our transcriptome assembly reveals that transcription correlates accurately with {DNA} methylation and accounts for approximately 85-90 \% of the methylome. We generate a mouse model in which transcription across the Zac1/Plagl1 locus is abrogated in oocytes, resulting in failure of {DNA} methylation establishment at all {CpGs} of this locus. {ChIP} analysis in oocytes reveals {H3K4me2} enrichment at the Zac1 imprinted control region when transcription is ablated, establishing a connection between transcription and chromatin remodeling at {CpG} islands by histone demethylases. {CONCLUSIONS}: By precisely defining the mouse oocyte transcriptome, this work not only highlights transcription as a cornerstone of {DNA} methylation establishment in female germ cells, but also provides an important resource for developmental biology research.}

Advances in next generation sequencing technologies are producing increasingly large numbers of {sRNA} reads per sample at a fraction of the cost of previous methods. However, many bioinformatics tools do not scale accordingly, are cumbersome, or require extensive support from bioinformatics experts. Therefore, researchers need user-friendly, robust tools, capable of not only processing large {sRNA} datasets in a reasonable time frame but also presenting the results in an intuitive fashion and visualizing {sRNA} genomic features. Herein, we present the {UEA} {sRNA} workbench, a suite of tools that is a successor to the web-based {UEA} {sRNA} Toolkit, but in downloadable format and with several enhanced and additional features. {AVAILABILITY}: The program and help pages are available at http://srna-workbench.cmp.uea.ac.uk. {CONTACT}: vincent.moulton@cmp.uea.ac.uk.}

abstract = {Mammalian spermatogenesis requires a stem cell pool, a period of amplification of cell numbers, the completion of reduction division to haploid cells (meiosis), and the morphological transformation of the haploid cells into spermatozoa (spermiogenesis). The net result of these processes is the production of massive numbers of spermatozoa over the reproductive lifetime of the animal. One study that utilized homogenization-resistant spermatids as the standard determined that human daily sperm production (dsp) was at 45 million per day per testis (60). For each human that means ∼1,000 sperm are produced per second. A key to this level of gamete production is the organization and architecture of the mammalian testes that results in continuous sperm production. The seemingly complex repetitious relationship of cells termed the "cycle of the seminiferous epithelium" is driven by the continuous commitment of undifferentiated spermatogonia to meiosis and the period of time required to form spermatozoa. This commitment termed the A to A1 transition requires the action of retinoic acid ({RA}) on the undifferentiated spermatogonia or prospermatogonia. In stages {VII} to {IX} of the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium, Sertoli cells and germ cells are influenced by pulses of {RA}. These pulses of {RA} move along the seminiferous tubules coincident with the spermatogenic wave, presumably undergoing constant synthesis and degradation. The {RA} pulse then serves as a trigger to commit undifferentiated progenitor cells to the rigidly timed pathway into meiosis and spermatid differentiation.

In addition, {RBPmap} incorporates a position-specific background model, designed uniquely for different genomic regions, such as splice sites, 5' and 3' {UTRs}, non-coding {RNA} and intergenic regions. {RBPmap} was tested on high-throughput {RNA}-binding experiments and was proved to be highly accurate. \copyright The Author(s) 2014.

Existing gene set tests that rely on gene permutation are shown here to be extremely sensitive to inter-gene correlation. Several data sets are analyzed to show that inter-gene correlation is non-ignorable even for experiments on homogeneous cell populations using genetically identical model organisms. A new gene set test procedure ({CAMERA}) is proposed based on the idea of estimating the inter-gene correlation from the data, and using it to adjust the gene set test statistic. An efficient procedure is developed for estimating the inter-gene correlation and characterizing its precision. {CAMERA} is shown to control the type I error rate correctly regardless of inter-gene correlations, yet retains excellent power for detecting genuine differential expression. Analysis of breast cancer data shows that {CAMERA} recovers known relationships between tumor subtypes in very convincing terms. {CAMERA} can be used to analyze specified sets or as a pathway analysis tool using a database of molecular signatures.}

The quality and interpretability of the {RGCCA} components are likely to be affected by the usefulness and relevance of the variables in each block. Therefore, it is an important issue to identify within each block which subsets of significant variables are active in the relationships between blocks. In this paper, {RGCCA} is extended to address the issue of variable selection. Specifically, sparse generalized canonical correlation analysis ({SGCCA}) is proposed to combine {RGCCA} with an [Formula: see text]-penalty in a unified framework. Within this framework, blocks are not necessarily fully connected, which makes {SGCCA} a flexible method for analyzing a wide variety of practical problems. Finally, the versatility and usefulness of {SGCCA} are illustrated on a simulated dataset and on a 3-block dataset which combine gene expression, comparative genomic hybridization, and a qualitative phenotype measured on a set of 53 children with glioma. {SGCCA} is available on {CRAN} as part of the {RGCCA} package. \copyright The Author 2014.

In the case of multiple highly correlated variables, another option is to use multivariate exploratory approaches to give more insight into cell biology, biological pathways or complex traits. {RESULTS}: A simple extension of a sparse {PLS} exploratory approach is proposed to perform variable selection in a multiclass classification framework. {CONCLUSIONS}: {sPLS}-{DA} has a classification performance similar to other wrapper or sparse discriminant analysis approaches on public microarray and {SNP} data sets.

Comparative methylation analysis using {ARM}-seq provides the first detailed, transcriptome-scale map of these modifications and reveals an abundance of previously undetected, methylated small {RNAs} derived from {tRNAs}. {ARM}-seq demonstrates that {tRNA} fragments accurately recapitulate the m(1)A modification state for well-characterized yeast {tRNAs} and generates new predictions for a large number of human {tRNAs}, including {tRNA} precursors and mitochondrial {tRNAs}.

abstract = {Inheritance is typically associated with the Mendelian transmission of information from parents to offspring by alleles ({DNA} sequence). However, empirical data clearly suggest that traits can be acquired from ancestors by mechanisms that do not involve genetic alleles, referred to as non-genetic inheritance. Information that is non-genetically transmitted across generations includes parental experience and exposure to certain environments, but also parental mutations and polymorphisms, because they can change the parental 'intrinsic' environment. Non-genetic inheritance is not limited to the first generation of the progeny, but can involve the grandchildren and even further generations. Non-genetic inheritance has been observed for multiple traits including overall development, cardiovascular risk and metabolic symptoms, but this review will focus on the inheritance of behavioral abnormalities pertinent to psychiatric disorders. Multigenerational non-genetic inheritance is often interpreted as the transmission of epigenetic marks, such as {DNA} methylation and chromatin modifications, via the gametes (transgenerational epigenetic inheritance). However, information can be carried across generations by a large number of bioactive substances, including hormones, cytokines, and even microorganisms, without the involvement of the gametes. We reason that this broader definition of non-genetic inheritance is more appropriate, especially in the context of psychiatric disorders, because of the well-recognized role of parental and early life environmental factors in later life psychopathology. Here we discuss the various forms of non-genetic inheritance in humans and animals, as well as rodent models of psychiatric conditions to illustrate possible mechanisms.}

The function of aminoacyl-{tRNA} synthesis is to precisely match amino acids with {tRNAs} containing the corresponding anticodon. This is primarily achieved by the direct attachment of an amino acid to the corresponding {tRNA} by an aminoacyl-{tRNA} synthetase, although intrinsic proofreading and extrinsic editing are also essential in several cases. Recent studies of aminoacyl-{tRNA} synthesis, mainly prompted by the advent of whole genome sequencing and the availability of a vast body of structural data, have led to an expanded and more detailed picture of how aminoacyl-{tRNAs} are synthesized.

abstract = {The {DNA} of each cell is wrapped around histone octamers, forming so-called 'nucleosomal core particles'. These histone proteins have tails that project from the nucleosome and many residues in these tails can be post-translationally modified, influencing all {DNA}-based processes, including chromatin compaction, nucleosome dynamics, and transcription. In contrast to those present in histone tails, modifications in the core regions of the histones had remained largely uncharacterised until recently, when some of these modifications began to be analysed in detail. Overall, recent work has shown that histone core modifications can not only directly regulate transcription, but also influence processes such as {DNA} repair, replication, stemness, and changes in cell state. In this review, we focus on the most recent developments in our understanding of histone modifications, particularly those on the lateral surface of the nucleosome. This region is in direct contact with the {DNA} and is formed by the histone cores. We suggest that these lateral surface modifications represent a key insight into chromatin regulation in the cell. Therefore, lateral surface modifications form a key area of interest and a focal point of ongoing study in epigenetics. Copyright \copyright 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

Many aberrant or differentially methylated sites have been discovered, but the mechanisms by which changes in {DNA} methylation lead to observed phenotypes, such as cancer, remain elusive. The classical view of methylation-mediated protein-{DNA} interactions is that only proteins with a methyl-{CpG} binding domain ({MBD}) can interact with methylated {DNA}. However, evidence is emerging to suggest that transcription factors lacking a {MBD} can also interact with methylated {DNA}. The identification of these proteins and the elucidation of their characteristics and the biological consequences of methylation-dependent transcription factor-{DNA} interactions are important stepping stones towards a mechanistic understanding of methylation-mediated biological processes, which have crucial implications for human development and disease.}

Once established, this pattern is frequently maintained over several cell divisions despite the fact that the initiating signal is no longer present. Differential packaging into chromatin is one such mechanism that allows fixation of transcriptional activity. Recent genome-wide studies demonstrate that actively transcribed regions are characterized by a specific modification pattern of histones, the main protein component of chromatin. These findings support the hypothesis that a histone code uses histone post-translational modifications to stably inscribe particular chromatin structures into the genome. Experiments on the dynamics of histone modifications reveal a striking kinetic difference between methylation, phosphorylation and acetylation, suggesting different roles of these modifications in epigenetically fixing specific gene expression patterns.

abstract = {Transgenerational inheritance of environment induced phenotype requires transmission of epigenetic information through the germline. Whereas several epigenetic factors have been implicated in germline transmission, mediators of information transfer from soma to the germline remain unidentified in mammals. Notably, a recent bioinformatic analysis showed association of extracellular {microRNAs} ({miRNAs}) and altered transcriptomes in diverse instances of mammalian epigenetic inheritance involving different environmental factors, tissues, life cycle stages, generations and genders. It was predicted that regulatory non-coding {RNAs} ({ncRNAs}) may potentially mediate soma to germline information transfer. Remarkably, the present bioinformatic evidence suggests similar association of exosomal {mRNAs} and proteins. The differentially expressed genes reported previously in genome level expression profiling studies related to or relevant in epigenetic inheritance showed enrichment for documented set of exosomal {mRNAs} in a few instances of epigenetic inheritance and of exosomal proteins in a majority of instances. Differentially expressed genes encoding exosomal {miRNAs} and proteins, directly or indirectly through first and/or second degree interactome networks, overrepresented biological processes related to environmental factors used in these instances as well as to epigenetic alterations, especially chromatin and histone modifications. These findings predict that exosomal {mRNAs} and proteins, like extracellular {miRNAs}, may also potentially mediate soma to germline information transfer. A convergent conceptual model is presented wherein extracellular {ncRNAs}/{miRNA}, {mRNAs} and proteins provide the much needed continuum inclusive of epigenetic inheritance. The phrase "transgenerational systems biology" is introduced to signify that the realm of systems biology extends beyond an individual organism and encompasses generations.

abstract = {Germline copy number variants ({CNVs}) and somatic copy number alterations ({SCNAs}) are of significant importance in syndromic conditions and cancer. Massively parallel sequencing is increasingly used to infer copy number information from variations in the read depth in sequencing data. However, this approach has limitations in the case of targeted re-sequencing, which leaves gaps in coverage between the regions chosen for enrichment and introduces biases related to the efficiency of target capture and library preparation. We present a method for copy number detection, implemented in the software package {CNVkit}, that uses both the targeted reads and the nonspecifically captured off-target reads to infer copy number evenly across the genome. This combination achieves both exon-level resolution in targeted regions and sufficient resolution in the larger intronic and intergenic regions to identify copy number changes. In particular, we successfully inferred copy number at equivalent to 100-kilobase resolution genome-wide from a platform targeting as few as 293 genes. After normalizing read counts to a pooled reference, we evaluated and corrected for three sources of bias that explain most of the extraneous variability in the sequencing read depth: {GC} content, target footprint size and spacing, and repetitive sequences. We compared the performance of {CNVkit} to copy number changes identified by array comparative genomic hybridization. We packaged the components of {CNVkit} so that it is straightforward to use and provides visualizations, detailed reporting of significant features, and export options for integration into existing analysis pipelines. {CNVkit} is freely available from https://github.com/etal/cnvkit.}

This computational approach is essential to understanding and visualizing the complex data that are acquired in high-throughput multidimensional biological experiments. Clustering enables researchers to make biological inferences for further experiments. Although a powerful technique, inappropriate application can lead biological researchers to waste resources and time in experimental follow-up. We review common pitfalls identified from the published molecular biology literature and present methods to avoid them. Commonly encountered pitfalls relate to the high-dimensional nature of biological data from high-throughput experiments, the failure to consider more than one clustering method for a given problem, and the difficulty in determining whether clustering has produced meaningful results. We present concrete examples of problems and solutions (clustering results) in the form of toy problems and real biological data for these issues. We also discuss ensemble clustering as an easy-to-implement method that enables the exploration of multiple clustering solutions and improves robustness of clustering solutions. Increased awareness of common clustering pitfalls will help researchers avoid overinterpreting or misinterpreting the results and missing valuable insights when clustering biological data.

Using whole genome bisulfite sequencing we identified hundreds of differentially methylated regions ({DMRs}) in humans compared to non-human primates and estimated that ∼25\% of these regions were detectable throughout several human tissues. Human {DMRs} were enriched for specific histone modifications and the majority were located distal to transcription start sites, highlighting the importance of regions outside the direct regulatory context. We also found a significant excess of endogenous retrovirus elements in human-specific hypomethylated.We reported for the first time a close interplay between inter-species genetic and epigenetic variation in regions of incomplete lineage sorting, transcription factor binding sites and human differentially hypermethylated regions. Specifically, we observed an excess of human-specific substitutions in transcription factor binding sites located within human {DMRs}, suggesting that alteration of regulatory motifs underlies some human-specific methylation patterns. We also found that the acquisition of {DNA} hypermethylation in the human lineage is frequently coupled with a rapid evolution at nucleotide level in the neighborhood of these {CpG} sites. Taken together, our results reveal new insights into the mechanistic basis of human-specific {DNA} methylation patterns and the interpretation of inter-species non-coding variation. \copyright The Author(s) 2015.

abstract = {The amino acid sequence of mammalian {DNA} methyltransferase has been deduced from the nucleotide sequence of a cloned {cDNA}. It appears that the mammalian enzyme arose during evolution via fusion of a prokaryotic restriction methyltransferase gene and a second gene of unknown function. Mammalian {DNA} methyltransferase currently comprises an N-terminal domain of about 1000 amino acids that may have a regulatory role and a C-terminal 570 amino acid domain that retains similarities to bacterial restriction methyltransferases. The sequence similarities among mammalian and bacterial {DNA} cytosine methyltransferases suggest a common evolutionary origin. {DNA} methylation is uncommon among those eukaryotes having genomes of less than 10(8) base pairs, but nearly universal among large-genome eukaryotes. This and other considerations make it likely that sequence inactivation by {DNA} methylation has evolved to compensate for the expansion of the genome that has accompanied the development of higher plants and animals. As methylated sequences are usually propagated in the repressed, nuclease-insensitive state, it is likely that {DNA} methylation compartmentalizes the genome to facilitate gene regulation by reducing the total amount of {DNA} sequence that must be scanned by {DNA}-binding regulatory proteins. {DNA} methylation is involved in immune recognition in bacteria but appears to regulate the structure and expression of the genome in complex higher eukaryotes. I suggest that the {DNA}-methylating system of mammals was derived from that of bacteria by way of a hypothetical intermediate that carried out selective de novo methylation of exogenous {DNA} and propagated the methylated {DNA} in the repressed state within its own genome.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 250 {WORDS})}

Presently, {RNU6B} (U6) is used for data normalization of circulating {miRNAs} in many studies. However, it was suggested that serum levels of U6 themselves might differ between individuals. Therefore, no consensus has been reached on the best normalization strategy in 'circulating {miRNA}'. We analyzed U6 levels as well as levels of spiked-in {SV40}-{RNA} in sera of 44 healthy volunteers, 203 intensive care unit patients and 64 patients with liver fibrosis. Levels of U6 demonstrated a high variability in sera of healthy donors, patients with critical illness and liver fibrosis. This high variability could also be confirmed in sera of mice after the cecal ligation and puncture procedure. Most importantly, levels of circulating U6 were significantly upregulated in sera of patients with critical illness and sepsis compared with controls and correlated with established markers of inflammation. In patients with liver fibrosis, U6 levels were significantly downregulated. In contrast, levels of spiked-in {SV40} displayed a significantly higher stability both in human cohorts (healthy, critical illness, liver fibrosis) and in mice. Thus, we conclude that U6 levels in the serum are dysregulated in a disease-specific manner. Therefore, U6 should not be used for data normalization of circulating {miRNAs} in inflammatory diseases and previous studies using this approach should be interpreted with caution. Further studies are warranted to identify specific regulatory processes of U6 levels in sepsis and liver fibrosis.}

Many transcriptomic studies aim at comparing either abundance levels or the transcriptome composition between given conditions, and as a first step, the sequencing reads must be used as the basis for abundance quantification of transcriptomic features of interest, such as genes or transcripts. Various quantification approaches have been proposed, ranging from simple counting of reads that overlap given genomic regions to more complex estimation of underlying transcript abundances. In this paper, we show that gene-level abundance estimates and statistical inference offer advantages over transcript-level analyses, in terms of performance and interpretability. We also illustrate that the presence of differential isoform usage can lead to inflated false discovery rates in differential gene expression analyses on simple count matrices but that this can be addressed by incorporating offsets derived from transcript-level abundance estimates. We also show that the problem is relatively minor in several real data sets. Finally, we provide an R package ( tximport) to help users integrate transcript-level abundance estimates from common quantification pipelines into count-based statistical inference engines.}

abstract = {Adult germline stem cells ({AGSCs}) self-renew (Thy1(+) enriched) or commit to gametogenesis (Kit(+) enriched). To better understand how chromatin regulates {AGSC} biology and gametogenesis, we derived stage-specific high-resolution profiles of {DNA} methylation, {5hmC}, histone modifications/variants, and {RNA}-seq in {AGSCs} and during spermatogenesis. First, we define striking signaling and transcriptional differences between {AGSC} types, involving key self-renewal and proliferation pathways. Second, key pluripotency factors (e.g., Nanog) are silent in {AGSCs} and bear particular chromatin/{DNAme} attributes that may "poise" them for reactivation after fertilization. Third, {AGSCs} display chromatin "poising/bivalency" of enhancers and promoters for embryonic transcription factors. Remarkably, gametogenesis occurs without significant changes in {DNAme} and instead involves transcription of {DNA}-methylated promoters bearing high {RNAPol2}, {H3K9ac}, {H3K4me3}, low {CG} content, and (often) {5hmC}. Furthermore, key findings were confirmed in human sperm. Here, we reveal {AGSC} signaling asymmetries and chromatin/{DNAme} strategies in {AGSCs} to poise key transcription factors and to activate {DNA}-methylated promoters during gametogenesis.

It can interrogate and perform detailed profiling analysis on {sRNAs} derived from annotated non-coding regions in {miRBase}, Rfam and {RepeatMasker}, as well as specific regions defined by users. The {ncPRO}-seq pipeline performs both gene-based and family-based analyses of {sRNAs}. It also has a module to identify regions significantly enriched with short reads, which cannot be classified under known {ncRNA} families, thus enabling the discovery of previously unknown {ncRNA}- or small interfering {RNA} ({siRNA})-producing regions. The {ncPRO}-seq pipeline supports input read sequences in fastq, fasta and color space format, as well as alignment results in {BAM} format, meaning that {sRNA} raw data from the three current major platforms (Roche-454, Illumina-Solexa and Life technologies-{SOLiD}) can be analyzed with this pipeline. The {ncPRO}-seq pipeline can be used to analyze read and alignment data, based on any sequenced genome, including mammals and plants. {AVAILABILITY}: Source code, annotation files, manual and online version are available at http://ncpro.curie.fr/. {CONTACT}: bioinfo.ncproseq@curie.fr or cciaudo@ethz.ch {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}

abstract = {Sperm is a highly differentiated cell type whose function is to deliver a haploid genome to the oocyte. The sperm "epigenomes" were traditionally considered to be insignificant - the sperm is transcriptionally inactive, its genome is packaged in sperm-specific protamine toroids instead of nucleosomes, and its {DNA} methylation profile is erased immediately post-fertilization. Yet, in recent years there has been an increase in the number of reported cases of apparent epigenetic inheritance through the male germline, suggesting that the sperm epigenome may transmit information between generations. At the same time, technical advances have made the genome-wide profiling of different layers of the sperm epigenome feasible. As a result, a large number of datasets have been recently generated and analyzed with the aim to better understand what non-genetic material is contained within the sperm and whether it has any function post-fertilization. Here, we provide an overview of the current knowledge of the sperm epigenomes as well as the challenges in analysing them and the opportunities in understanding the potential non-genetic carriers of information in sperm.}

Epididymosomes are heterogeneous in terms of both size and molecular composition. Exosomes and other related small membranous vesicles (30-120 nm) containing tetraspanin proteins on their surface are found in many biological fluids. In this study, we demonstrate that these vesicles are present in bovine cauda epididymal fluid as a subpopulation of epididymosomes. They contain tetraspanin {CD9} in addition to other proteins involved in sperm maturation such as P25b, {GliPr1L1}, and {MIF}. In order to study the mechanism of protein transfer to sperm, {DilC12}-labeled unfractionated epididymosomes or {CD9}-positive microvesicles were coincubated with epididymal spermatozoa, and their transfer was evaluated by flow cytometry. {CD9}-positive microvesicles from epididymal fluid specifically transferred molecules to spermatozoa, whereas those prepared from blood were unable to do so. The {CD9}-positive microvesicles transferred molecules to the same sperm regions (acrosome and midpiece) as epididymosomes, with the same kinetics; however, the molecules were preferentially transferred to live sperm and, in contrast to epididymosomes, Zn(2+) did not demonstrate potentiated transfer. Tetraspanin {CD9} was associated with other proteins on the membrane surface of {CD9}-positive microvesicles according to coimmunoprecipitation experiments. {CD26} cooperated with {CD9} in the molecular transfer to sperm since the amount of molecules transferred was significantly reduced in the presence of specific antibodies. In conclusion, {CD9}-positive microvesicles are present in bovine cauda epididymal fluid and transfer molecules to live maturing sperm in a tissue-specific manner that involves {CD9} and {CD26}.}

Recent papers argue that epigenetic marks acquired through experience are passed to offspring, but as in much of the field of epigenetics, there is lack of precision in the definitions and perhaps too much eagerness to translate animal research to humans. Here, we review operational definitions of transgenerational inheritance and the processes of epigenetic programing during early development. Subsequently, based on this background, we critically examine some recent findings of studies investigating transgenerational inheritance. Finally, we discuss possible mechanisms that may explain transgenerational inheritance, including transmission of an epigenetic blueprint, which may predispose offspring to specific epigenetic patterning. Taken together, we conclude that presently, the evidence suggesting that acquired epigenetic marks are passed to the subsequent generation remains limited.}

In addition, the mobilization of active {TEs} in selected cell types has been shown to generate genetic variation during development and in fully differentiated tissues. Importantly, the ongoing domestication and evolution of {TEs} appears to provide a rich source of regulatory elements, functional modules and genetic variation that fuels the evolution of mammalian developmental processes.

We developed a new strategy to identify imprinted gene-associated {DMRs}. Using genome-wide methylation profiling of sodium bisulfite modified {DNA} from normal human tissues of biparental origin, candidate {DMRs} were identified by selecting {CpGs} with methylation levels consistent with putative allelic differential methylation. In parallel, the methylation profiles of tissues of uniparental origin, i.e., paternally-derived androgenetic complete hydatidiform moles ({AnCHMs}), and maternally-derived mature cystic ovarian teratoma ({MCT}), were examined and then used to identify {CpGs} with parent of origin-specific {DNA} methylation. With this approach, we found known {DMRs} associated with imprinted genomic regions as well as new {DMRs} for known imprinted genes, {NAP1L5} and {ZNF597}, and novel candidate imprinted genes. The paternally methylated {DMR} for one candidate, {AXL}, a receptor tyrosine kinase, was also validated in experiments with mouse embryos that demonstrated Axl was expressed preferentially from the maternal allele in a {DNA} methylation-dependent manner.}

Variant histones are assembled into nucleosomes in a replication-independent manner, in contrast to assembly of bulk chromatin that is coupled to replication. Recent in vitro studies have provided the first glimpses of protein machines dedicated to building and replacing alternative nucleosomes. They deposit variant {H2A} and H3 histones and are targeted to particular functional sites in the genome. Differences between variant and canonical histones can have profound consequences, either for delivery of the histones to sites of assembly or for their function after incorporation into chromatin. Recent studies have also revealed connections between assembly of variant nucleosomes, chromatin remodeling, and histone post-translational modification. Taken together, these findings indicate that chromosome architecture can be highly dynamic at the most fundamental level, with epigenetic consequences.}

We also present new approaches that promise definitive functional answers, which are collectively referred to as 'epigenome editing'.

Release of extracellular vesicles from its cell of origin occurs either through the outward budding of the plasma membrane or through the inward budding of the endosomal membrane, resulting in the formation of multivesicular bodies, which release vesicles upon fusion with the plasma membrane. The release of vesicles can facilitate intercellular communication by contact with or by internalization of contents, either by fusion with the plasma membrane or by endocytosis into "recipient" cells. Although the interest in extracellular vesicle research is increasing, there are still no real standards in place to separate or classify the different types of vesicles.

In {RNA}-Seq however the artifactual reads are not easy to tell apart from normal read duplication due to natural over-sequencing of highly expressed genes. Especially when working with little input material or single cells assessing the fraction of duplicate reads is an important quality control step for {NGS} data sets. Up to now there are only tools to calculate the global duplication rates that do not take into account the effect of gene expression levels which leaves them of limited use for {RNA}-Seq data. {RESULTS}: Here we present the tool {dupRadar}, which provides an easy means to distinguish the fraction of reads originating in natural duplication due to high expression from the fraction induced by artefacts. {dupRadar} assesses the fraction of duplicate reads per gene dependent on the expression level. Apart from the Bioconductor package {dupRadar} we provide shell scripts for easy integration into processing pipelines. {CONCLUSIONS}: The Bioconductor package {dupRadar} offers straight-forward methods to assess {RNA}-Seq datasets for quality issues with {PCR} duplicates.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: {MicroRNAs} ({miRNAs}), a growing class of small {RNAs} with crucial regulatory roles at the post-transcriptional level, are usually found to be clustered on chromosomes. However, with the exception of a few individual cases, so far little is known about the functional consequence of this conserved clustering of {miRNA} loci. In animal genomes such clusters often contain non-homologous {miRNA} genes. One hypothesis to explain this heterogeneity suggests that clustered {miRNAs} are functionally related by virtue of co-targeting downstream pathways. {RESULTS}: Integrating of {miRNA} cluster information with protein protein interaction ({PPI}) network data, our research supports the hypothesis of the functional coordination of clustered {miRNAs} and links it to the topological features of {miRNAs}' targets in {PPI} network. Specifically, our results demonstrate that clustered {miRNAs} jointly regulate proteins in close proximity of the {PPI} network. The possibility that two proteins yield to this coordinated regulation is negatively correlated with their distance in {PPI} network. Guided by the knowledge of this preference, we found several network communities enriched with target genes of {miRNA} clusters. In addition, our results demonstrate that the variance of this propensity can also partly be explained by protein's connectivity and {miRNA}'s conservation. {CONCLUSION}: In summary, this work supports the hypothesis of intra-cluster coordination and investigates the extent of this coordination.}

abstract = {Post-translational modification of histones, a major protein component of eukaryotic chromosomes, contributes to the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Distinct patterns of histone modification are observed at specific chromosomal regions and affect various reactions on chromosomes (transcription, replication, repair, and recombination). Histone modification has long been proposed to have a profound effect on eukaryotic gene expression since its discovery in 1964. Verification of this idea, however, was difficult until the identification of enzymes responsible for histone modifications. Ten years ago (1995), histone acetyltransferases ({HATs}), which acetylate lysine residues in histone amino-terminal tail regions, were isolated. {HATs} are involved in the regulation of both promoter-specific transcription and long-range/chromosome-wide transcription. Analyses of {HATs} and other modification enzymes have revealed mechanisms of epigenetic regulation that are mediated by post-translational modifications of histones. Here we review some major advances in the field, with emphasis on the lysine specificity of the acetylation reaction and on the regulation of gene expression over broad regions.}

abstract = {{DNA} methylation contributes to gene and transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes, and therefore has been hypothesized to facilitate the evolution of plastic traits such as sociality in insects. However, {DNA} methylation is sparsely studied in insects. Therefore, we documented patterns of {DNA} methylation across a wide diversity of insects. We predicted that underlying enzymatic machinery is concordant with patterns of {DNA} methylation. Finally, given the suggestion that {DNA} methylation facilitated social evolution in Hymenoptera, we tested the hypothesis that the {DNA} methylation system will be associated with presence/absence of sociality among other insect orders. We found {DNA} methylation to be widespread, detected in all orders examined except Diptera (flies). Whole genome bisulfite sequencing showed that orders differed in levels of {DNA} methylation. Hymenopteran (ants, bees, wasps and sawflies) had some of the lowest levels, including several potential losses. Blattodea (cockroaches and termites) show all possible patterns, including a potential loss of {DNA} methylation in a eusocial species whereas solitary species had the highest levels. Species with {DNA} methylation do not always possess the typical enzymatic machinery. We identified a gene duplication event in the maintenance {DNA} methyltransferase 1 ({DNMT1}) that is shared by some Hymenoptera, and paralogs have experienced divergent, nonneutral evolution. This diversity and nonneutral evolution of underlying machinery suggests alternative {DNA} methylation pathways may exist. Phylogenetically corrected comparisons revealed no evidence that supports evolutionary association between sociality and {DNA} methylation. Future functional studies will be required to advance our understanding of {DNA} methylation in insects. \copyright The Author 2016.

abstract = {Mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of tumorigenesis. Although mitochondrial function can impact cell cycle regulation it has been an understudied area in cancer research. Our study highlights a specific involvement of mitochondria in cell cycle regulation across cancer types. The mitochondrial fission process, which is regulated at the core by Drp1, impacts various cellular functions. Drp1 has been implicated in various cancer types with no common mechanism reported. Our Drp1-directed large-scale analyses of the publically available cancer genomes reveal a robust correlation of Drp1 with cell-cycle genes in 29 of the 31 cancer types examined. Hypothesis driven investigation on epithelial ovarian cancer ({EOC}) revealed that Drp1 co-expresses specifically with the cell-cycle module responsible for mitotic transition. Repression of Drp1 in {EOC} cells can specifically attenuate mitotic transition, establishing a potential casual role of Drp1 in mitotic transition. Interestingly, Drp1-Cell-Cycle co-expression module is specifically detected in primary epithelial ovarian tumors that robustly responded to chemotherapy, suggesting that Drp1 driven mitosis may underlie chemo-sensitivity of the primary tumors. Analyses of matched primary and relapsed {EOC} samples revealed a Drp1-based-gene-expression-signature that could identify patients with poor survival probabilities from their primary tumors. Our results imply that around 60\% of platinum-sensitive {EOC} patients undergoing relapse show poor survival, potentially due to further activation of a mitochondria driven cell-cycle regime in their recurrent disease. We speculate that this patient group could possibly benefit from mitochondria directed therapies that are being currently evaluated at various levels, thus enabling targeted or personalized therapy based cancer management.}

abstract = {In trangenerational epigenetic inheritance, phenotypic information not encoded in {DNA} sequence is transmitted across generations. In germline-dependent mode, memory of environmental exposure in parental generation is transmitted through gametes, leading to appearance of phenotypes in the unexposed future generations. The memory is considered to be encoded in epigenetic factors like {DNA} methylation, histone modifications and regulatory {RNAs}. Environmental exposure may cause epigenetic modifications in the germline either directly or indirectly through primarily affecting the soma. The latter possibility is most intriguing because it contradicts the established dogma that hereditary information flows only from germline to soma, not in reverse. As such, identification of the factor(s) mediating soma to germline information transfer in transgenerational epigenetic inheritance would be pathbreaking. Regulatory {RNAs} and hormone have previously been implicated or proposed to play a role in soma to germline communication in epigenetic inheritance. This review examines the recent examples of gametogenic transgenerational inheritance in plants and animals in order to assess if evidence of regulatory {RNAs} and hormones as mediators of information transfer is supported. Overall, direct evidence for both mobile regulatory {RNAs} and hormones is found to exist in plants. In animals, although involvement of mobile {RNAs} seems imminent, direct evidence of {RNA}-mediated soma to germline information transfer in transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is yet to be obtained. Direct evidence is also lacking for hormones in animals. However, detailed examination of recently reported examples of transgenerational inheritance reveals circumstantial evidence supporting a role of hormones in information transmission.

Expression of the liver-specific {miR}-122 was significantly up-regulated in {HBV}-infected patients. Concomitant regulation of {miRNAs} not in clusters was disrupted by {HBV} infection. However, such disruption was not observed for {miRNAs} in paralogous clusters. Furthermore, the level of {miRNAs} in the {CHB} serum was up-regulated most in hepatitis B e antigen-positive patients. The expression levels of {miR}-122 and {miR}-194 correlated negatively with the age of patients with {CHB} or {ACLF}. Functional analysis showed that {miR}-122 could inhibit {HBV} replication in Huh7 and {HepG2} cells.

Here we explore the consequences of "batch" correction for biological discovery in two publicly available expression datasets. We consider this to include the estimation of and adjustment for wide-spread systematic heterogeneity in genomic measurements that is unrelated to the effects under study, whether it be technical or biological in nature. {METHODS}: We present three illustrative data analyses using surrogate variable analysis ({SVA}) and describe how to perform artifact discovery in light of natural heterogeneity within biological groups, secondary biological questions of interest, and non-linear treatment effects in a dataset profiling differentiating pluripotent cells ({GSE32923}) and another from human brain tissue ({GSE30272}). {RESULTS}: Careful specification of biological effects of interest is very important to factor-based approaches like {SVA}. We demonstrate greatly sharpened global and gene-specific differential expression across treatment groups in stem cell systems. Similarly, we demonstrate how to preserve major non-linear effects of age across the lifespan in the brain dataset. However, the gains in precisely defining known effects of interest come at the cost of much other information in the "cleaned" data, including sex, common copy number effects and sample or cell line-specific molecular behavior. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our analyses indicate that data "cleaning" can be an important component of high-throughput genomic data analysis when interrogating explicitly defined effects in the context of data affected by robust technical artifacts. However, caution should be exercised to avoid removing biological signal of interest. It is also important to note that open data exploration is not possible after such supervised "cleaning", because effects beyond those stipulated by the researcher may have been removed. With the goal of making these statistical algorithms more powerful and transparent to researchers in the biological sciences, we provide exploratory plots and accompanying R code for identifying and guiding "cleaning" process (https://github.com/andrewejaffe/{StemCellSVA}). The impact of these methods is significant enough that we have made newly processed data available for the brain data set at http://braincloud.jhmi.edu/plots/ and {GSE30272}.}

Despite increasing knowledge about {DNA} methylation, we still lack a complete understanding of its specific functions and correlation with environment and gene expression in diverse organisms. To understand how global {DNA} methylation levels changed under environmental influence during vertebrate evolution, we analyzed its distribution pattern along the whole genome in mammals, reptiles and fishes showing that it is correlated with temperature, independently on phylogenetic inheritance. Other studies in mammals and plants have evidenced that environmental stimuli can promote epigenetic changes that, in turn, might generate localized changes in {DNA} sequence resulting in phenotypic effects. All these observations suggest that environment can affect the epigenome of vertebrates by generating hugely different methylation patterns that could, possibly, reflect in phenotypic differences. We are at the first steps towards the understanding of mechanisms that underlie the role of environment in molding the entire genome over evolutionary times. The next challenge will be to map similarities and differences of {DNA} methylation in vertebrates and to associate them with environmental adaptation and evolution.}

To better understand, we conducted extensive genomic profiling at multiple postnatal stages on subpopulations enriched for particular markers ({THY1}, {KIT}, {OCT4}, {ID4}, or {GFRa1}). Overall, our profiles suggest three broad populations of spermatogonia in juveniles: (1) epithelial-like spermatogonia ({THY1}(+); high {OCT4}, {ID4}, and {GFRa1}), (2) more abundant mesenchymal-like spermatogonia ({THY1}(+); moderate {OCT4} and {ID4}; high mesenchymal markers), and (3) (in older juveniles) abundant spermatogonia committing to gametogenesis (high {KIT}(+)). Epithelial-like spermatogonia displayed the expected imprinting patterns, but, surprisingly, mesenchymal-like spermatogonia lacked imprinting specifically at paternally imprinted loci but fully restored imprinting prior to puberty. Furthermore, mesenchymal-like spermatogonia also displayed developmentally linked {DNA} demethylation at meiotic genes and also at certain monoallelic neural genes (e.g., protocadherins and olfactory receptors). We also reveal novel candidate receptor-ligand networks involving {\SSCs} and the developing niche. Taken together, neonates/juveniles contain heterogeneous epithelial-like or mesenchymal-like spermatogonial populations, with the latter displaying extensive {DNA} methylation/chromatin dynamics. We speculate that this plasticity helps {\SSCs} proliferate and migrate within the developing seminiferous tubule, with proper niche interaction and membrane attachment reverting mesenchymal-like spermatogonial subtype cells back to an epithelial-like state with normal imprinting profiles. \copyright 2015 Hammoud et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.}

Many genes/proteins have been identified with specific expression profiles in individual spermatogonial cell types but the molecular mechanism of their regulation is still obscure. In this review, an overview of current knowledge on the various factors essential for these two major steps of spermatogonial development is presented. Elucidating the function of these factors was typically made possible through either naturally occurring mutant mice or genetically modified mice, in which a specific and clearly defined spermatogonial arrest is seen. In addition, a few factors, which are potentially important but less clearly defined, are also included. Moreover, the relevance and postulated interactions between these factors is discussed.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: In the last few years several studies have shown that Transposable Elements ({TEs}) in the human genome are significantly associated with Transcription Factor Binding Sites ({TFBSs}) and that in several cases their expansion within the genome led to a substantial rewiring of the regulatory network. Another important feature of the regulatory network which has been thoroughly studied is the combinatorial organization of transcriptional regulation. In this paper we combine these two observations and suggest that {TEs}, besides rewiring the network, also played a central role in the evolution of particular patterns of combinatorial gene regulation. {RESULTS}: To address this issue we searched for {TEs} overlapping Estrogen Receptor \alpha ({ER\alpha}) binding peaks in two publicly available {ChIP}-seq datasets from the {MCF7} cell line corresponding to different modalities of exposure to estrogen. We found a remarkable enrichment of a few specific classes of Transposons. Among these a prominent role was played by {MIR} (Mammalian Interspersed Repeats) transposons. These {TEs} underwent a dramatic expansion at the beginning of the mammalian radiation and then stabilized. We conjecture that the special affinity of {ER\alpha} for the {MIR} class of {TEs} could be at the origin of the important role assumed by {ER\alpha} in Mammalians. We then searched for {TFBSs} within the {TEs} overlapping {ChIP}-seq peaks. We found a strong enrichment of a few precise combinations of {TFBS}. In several cases the corresponding Transcription Factors ({TFs}) were known cofactors of {ER\alpha}, thus supporting the idea of a co-regulatory role of {TFBS} within the same {TE}. Moreover, most of these correlations turned out to be strictly associated to specific classes of {TEs} thus suggesting the presence of a well-defined "transposon code" within the regulatory network. {CONCLUSIONS}: In this work we tried to shed light into the role of Transposable Elements ({TEs}) in shaping the regulatory network of higher eukaryotes. To test this idea we focused on a particular transcription factor: the Estrogen Receptor \alpha ({ER\alpha}) and we found that {ER\alpha} preferentially targets a well defined set of {TEs} and that these {TEs} host combinations of transcriptional regulators involving several of known co-regulators of {ER\alpha}. Moreover, a significant number of these {TEs} turned out to be conserved between human and mouse and located in the vicinity (and thus candidate to be regulators) of important estrogen-related genes.}

One of the key steps in {sRNA}-seq data analysis is alignment to a reference genome. {sRNA}-seq libraries often have a high proportion of reads that align to multiple genomic locations, which makes determining their true origins difficult. Commonly used {sRNA}-seq alignment methods result in either very low precision (choosing an alignment at random), or sensitivity (ignoring multi-mapping reads). Here, we describe and test an {sRNA}-seq alignment strategy that uses local genomic context to guide decisions on proper placements of multi-mapped {sRNA}-seq reads. Tests using simulated {sRNA}-seq data demonstrated that this local-weighting method outperforms other alignment strategies using three different plant genomes. Experimental analyses with real {sRNA}-seq data also indicate superior performance of local-weighting methods for both plant {miRNAs} and heterochromatic {siRNAs}. The local-weighting methods we have developed are implemented as part of the {sRNA}-seq analysis program {ShortStack}, which is freely available under a general public license.

However, differential usage of gene transcripts between conditions (isoform switching) has not been comprehensively characterized in and across cancer types. To this end, we developed methods for identification and visualization of isoform switches with predicted functional consequences. Using these methods, we characterized isoform switching in {RNA}-seq data from \textgreater5,500 cancer patients covering 12 solid cancer types. Isoform switches with potential functional consequences were common, affecting approximately 19\% of multiple transcript genes. Among these, isoform switches leading to loss of {DNA} sequence encoding protein domains were more frequent than expected, particularly in pancancer switches. We identified several isoform switches as powerful biomarkers: 31 switches were highly predictive of patient survival independent of cancer types. Our data constitute an important resource for cancer researchers, available through interactive web tools. Moreover, our methods, available as an R package, enable systematic analysis of isoform switches from other {RNA}-seq datasets.Implications: This study indicates that isoform switches with predicted functional consequences are common and important in dysfunctional cells, which in turn means that gene expression should be analyzed at the isoform level.

Typical experimental design consists in comparing two conditions with several replicates using a differential gene expression test followed by preranked {GSEA} performed against a collection of hundreds and thousands of pathways. However, the reference implementation of this method cannot accurately estimate small P-values, which significantly limits its sensitivity due to multiple hypotheses correction procedure. Here we present {FGSEA} (Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) method that is able to estimate arbitrarily low {GSEA} P-values with a high accuracy in a matter of minutes or even seconds. To confirm the accuracy of the method, we also developed an exact algorithm for {GSEA} P-values calculation for integer gene-level statistics. Using the exact algorithm as a reference we show that {FGSEA} is able to routinely estimate P-values up to 10 −100 with a small and predictable estimation error. We systematically evaluate {FGSEA} on a collection of 605 datasets and show that {FGSEA} recovers much more statistically significant pathways compared to other implementations. {FGSEA} is open source and available as an R package in Bioconductor ( http://bioconductor.org/packages/fgsea/ ) and on {GitHub} ( https://github.com/ctlab/fgsea/ ).}

We identified a total of 26 post-translational modifications ({PTMs}) on specific residues of the core histones {H2B}, H3 and H4, and the linker histone H1, four of which had not been described previously in any tissue or cell line. We also detected 11 novel {PTMs} on the protamines {PRM1} and {PRM2} and observed that they are present in specific combinations on individual protamines. {CONCLUSIONS}: Both histones and protamines carry multiple {PTMs} in the adult mouse sperm. On protamines, specific {PTM} combinations might form a 'protamine code' similar to the 'histone code'. These findings suggest a potential role for {PTMs} on sperm histones and protamines in epigenetic signatures underlying transgenerational inheritance.}

Here, we show that most promoters in mouse sperm are flanked by well-positioned nucleosomes marked by active histone modifications. Analysis of these modifications suggests that many enhancers and super-enhancers functional in embryonic and adult tissues are already specified in sperm. The sperm genome is bound by {CTCF} and cohesin at sites that are also present in round spermatids and embryonic stem cells ({ESCs}). These sites mediate interactions that organize the sperm genome into domains and compartments that overlap extensively with those found in {mESCs}. These results suggest that sperm carry a rich source of regulatory information, encoded in part by its three-dimensional folding specified by {CTCF} and cohesin. This information may contribute to future expression during embryonic and adult life, suggesting mechanisms by which environmental effects on the paternal germline are transmitted transgenerationally.

Here we used an Id4-{eGfp} reporter mouse to discover that {EGFP} intensity is predictive of the subsets, with the {ID4}-{EGFPBright} population being mostly, if not purely, {\SSCs}, whereas the {ID4}-{EGFPDim} population is in transition to the progenitor state. These subsets are also distinguishable by transcriptome signatures. Moreover, using a conditional overexpression mouse model, we found that transition from the stem cell to the immediate progenitor state requires downregulation of Id4 coincident with a major change in the transcriptome.

We found that Id4(+) cells continue to produce spermatogonia, spermatocytes and sperm in mouse testis, showing they are capable of self-renewal and have differentiation potential. Consistent with these findings, ablation of Id4(+) cells in mice results in a loss of spermatogenesis.

We used {FACS} to isolate individual cell populations and then generated cell-specific transcriptome profiles across different stages of spermatogenesis in two subspecies of house mice (Mus musculus), thereby overcoming a fundamental limitation of previous studies on whole tissues. We found faster-X protein evolution at all stages of spermatogenesis and faster-late protein evolution for both X-linked and autosomal genes. In contrast, there was less expression divergence late in spermatogenesis (slower late) on the X chromosome and for autosomal genes expressed primarily in testis (testis-biased). We argue that slower-late expression divergence reflects strong regulatory constraints imposed during this critical stage of sperm development and that these constraints are particularly acute on the tightly regulated sex chromosomes. We also found slower-X {DNA} methylation divergence based on genome-wide bisulfite sequencing of sperm from two species of mice (M. musculus and M. spretus), although it is unclear whether slower-X {DNA} methylation reflects development constraints in sperm or other X-linked phenomena. Our study clarifies key differences in patterns of regulatory and protein evolution across spermatogenesis that are likely to have important consequences for mammalian sex chromosome evolution, male fertility, and speciation.

Unlike in somatic cells, there are few nucleosomes in sperm, and their function in epigenetic inheritance is unknown. We generated transgenic mice in which overexpression of the histone H3 lysine 4 ({H3K4}) demethylase {KDM1A} (also known as {LSD1}) during spermatogenesis reduced {H3K4} dimethylation in sperm. {KDM1A} overexpression in one generation severely impaired development and survivability of offspring. These defects persisted transgenerationally in the absence of {KDM1A} germline expression and were associated with altered {RNA} profiles in sperm and offspring. We show that epigenetic inheritance of aberrant development can be initiated by histone demethylase activity in developing sperm, without changes to {DNA} methylation at {CpG}-rich regions.

Epigenetic marks are mitotically inherited in somatic cells and may be altered in response to internal and external stimuli. The idea that environment-induced epigenetic changes in mammals could be inherited through the germline, independent of genetic mechanisms, has stimulated much debate. Many experimental models have been designed to interrogate the possibility of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance and provide insight into how environmental exposures influence phenotypes over multiple generations in the absence of any apparent genetic mutation. Unexpected molecular evidence has forced us to reevaluate not only our understanding of the plasticity and heritability of epigenetic factors, but of the stability of the genome as well. Recent reviews have described the difference between transgenerational and intergenerational effects; the two major epigenetic reprogramming events in the mammalian lifecycle; these two events making transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of environment-induced perturbations rare, if at all possible, in mammals; and mechanisms of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in non-mammalian eukaryotic organisms. This paper briefly introduces these topics and mainly focuses on (1) transgenerational phenotypes and epigenetic effects in mammals, (2) environment-induced intergenerational epigenetic effects, and (3) the inherent difficulties in establishing a role for epigenetic inheritance in human environmental disease.

This non-genetic form of inheritance is termed epigenetic transgenerational inheritance and has been shown in a variety of species including plants, flies, worms, fish, rodents, pigs, and humans. This phenomenon operates during specific critical windows of exposure, linked to the developmental biology of the germ cells (sperm and eggs). Therefore, concepts of the developmental origins of transgenerational inheritance of phenotypic variation and subsequent disease risk need to include epigenetic processes affecting the developmental biology of the germ cell. These developmental impacts on epigenetic transgenerational inheritance, in contrast to multigenerational exposures, are the focus of this Perspective.}

Epigenetic marks, including {DNA} methylation, histones, chromatin structure, and noncoding {RNAs}, are modified throughout life in response to environmental and behavioral influences. With each new generation, {DNA} methylation patterns are erased in gametes and reset after fertilization, probably to prevent these epigenetic marks from being transferred from parents to their offspring. However, some recent animal studies suggest an apparent resistance to complete erasure of epigenetic marks during early development, enabling transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. Whether there are similar mechanisms in humans remains unclear, with the exception of epigenetic imprinting. Nevertheless, a distinctly different mechanism-namely, intrauterine exposure to environmental stressors that may affect establishment of the newly composing epigenetic patterns after fertilization-is often confused with transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. In this review, we delineate the definition of and requirement for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, differentiate it from the consequences of intrauterine exposure, and discuss the available evidence in both animal models and humans.-Van Otterdijk, S.

Nextera combines {DNA} fragmentation and barcoding in a single tube reaction and therefore enables a very fast workflow to sequencing-ready {DNA} libraries within a couple of hours. When compared to the traditional ligation-based methods, transposed-based Nextera has a slight insertion bias. {RESULTS}: Here we present the discovery of a mutant transposase (Tn5-059) with a lowered {GC} insertion bias through protein engineering. We demonstrate Tn5-059 reduces {AT} dropout and increases uniformity of genome coverage in both bacterial genomes and human genome. We also observe higher library diversity generated by Tn5-059 when compared to Nextera v2 for human exomes, which leads to less sequencing and lower cost per genome. In addition, when used for human exomes, Tn5-059 delivers consistent library insert size over a range of input {DNA}, allowing up to a tenfold variance from the 50 ng input recommendation. {CONCLUSIONS}: Enhanced {DNA} input tolerance of Tn5-059 can translate to flexibility and robustness of workflow. {DNA} input tolerance together with superior uniformity of coverage and lower {AT} dropouts extend the applications of transposase based library preps. We discuss possible mechanisms of improvements in Tn5-059, and potential advantages of using the new mutant in varieties of applications including microbiome sequencing and chromatin profiling.}

To explore how epigenetic and genetic changes are linked during primate evolution, we have compared the genome-wide {DNA} methylation profiles (methylomes) of humans and chimpanzees, which have a 1.2\% {DNA} sequence divergence, of sperm, the frontal cortices, B cells, and neutrophils. We revealed that species-specific differentially methylated regions (S-{DMRs}), ranging from several hundred base pairs (bp) to several kilo base pairs (kb), were frequently associated with sequence changes in transcription factor-binding sites and insertions of Alu and {SVA} retrotransposons. We then generated a reference macaque sperm methylome map and revealed, in sperm, that both human and chimpanzee S-{DMRs} arose more frequently owing to methylation loss rather than gain. Moreover, we observed that the sperm methylomes contained many more hypomethylated domains ({HMDs}), ranging from 20 to 500 kb, than did the somatic methylomes. Interestingly, the sperm {HMDs} changed rapidly during primate evolution; hundreds of sperm {HMDs} were specific to humans, whereas most somatic {HMDs} were highly conserved between humans and chimpanzees. Notably, these human-specific sperm {HMDs} frequently occurred in regions exhibiting copy number variations. Our findings indicate that primate evolution, particularly in the germline, is significantly impacted by reciprocal changes in the genome and epigenome. \copyright The Author 2017.

It has been postulated that such exchange is communicated to maturing spermatozoa via the transfer of small non-protein-coding {RNAs} ({sRNAs}) in a mechanism mediated by epididymosomes; small membrane bound vesicles released by the soma of the male reproductive tract (epididymis). Here we confirm that mouse epididymosomes encapsulate an impressive cargo of \textgreater350 {microRNAs} ({miRNAs}), a developmentally important {sRNA} class, the majority (\~60\%) of which are also represented by the {miRNA} signature of spermatozoa. This includes \textgreater50 {miRNAs} that were found exclusively in epididymal sperm and epididymosomes, but not in the surrounding soma. We also documented substantial changes in the epididymosome {miRNA} cargo, including significant fold changes in almost half of the {miRNAs} along the length of the epididymis. Finally, we provide the first direct evidence for the transfer of several prominent {miRNA} species between mouse epididymosomes and spermatozoa to afford novel insight into a mechanism of intercellular communication by which the {sRNA} payload of sperm can be selectively modified during their post-testicular maturation.}

Transplantation studies provided definitive evidence that a {TSPAN8}-high subpopulation is enriched for {\SSCs}. {RNA}-seq analyses identified genes differentially expressed between {TSPAN8}-high and -low subpopulations that clustered into multiple biological pathways potentially involved in {\SSC} renewal or differentiation, respectively. Methyl-seq analysis identified hypomethylated domains in the promoters of these genes in both subpopulations that colocalized with peaks of histone modifications defined by {ChIP}-seq analysis.

In recent years, there has been a proliferation of {GSE} analysis methods and hence it has become increasingly difficult for researchers to select an optimal {GSE} tool based on their particular dataset. Moreover, the majority of {GSE} analysis methods do not allow researchers to simultaneously compare gene set level results between multiple experimental conditions. Results: The ensemble of genes set enrichment analyses ({EGSEA}) is a method developed for {RNA}-sequencing data that combines results from twelve algorithms and calculates collective gene set scores to improve the biological relevance of the highest ranked gene sets. {EGSEA}'s gene set database contains around 25 000 gene sets from sixteen collections. It has multiple visualization capabilities that allow researchers to view gene sets at various levels of granularity. {EGSEA} has been tested on simulated data and on a number of human and mouse datasets and, based on biologists' feedback, consistently outperforms the individual tools that have been combined. Our evaluation demonstrates the superiority of the ensemble approach for {GSE} analysis, and its utility to effectively and efficiently extrapolate biological functions and potential involvement in disease processes from lists of differentially regulated genes. Availability and Implementation: {EGSEA} is available as an R package at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/{EGSEA}/ . The gene sets collections are available in the R package {EGSEAdata} from http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/{EGSEAdata}/ . Contacts: monther.alhamdoosh@csl.com.au mritchie@wehi.edu.au.

Combining such large-scale biological data sets can lead to the discovery of important biological insights, provided that relevant information can be extracted in a holistic manner. Current statistical approaches have been focusing on identifying small subsets of molecules (a 'molecular signature') to explain or predict biological conditions, but mainly for a single type of 'omics. In addition, commonly used methods are univariate and consider each biological feature independently. We introduce {mixOmics}, an R package dedicated to the multivariate analysis of biological data sets with a specific focus on data exploration, dimension reduction and visualisation. By adopting a systems biology approach, the toolkit provides a wide range of methods that statistically integrate several data sets at once to probe relationships between heterogeneous 'omics data sets. Our recent methods extend Projection to Latent Structure ({PLS}) models for discriminant analysis, for data integration across multiple 'omics data or across independent studies, and for the identification of molecular signatures. We illustrate our latest {mixOmics} integrative frameworks for the multivariate analyses of 'omics data available from the package.}

abstract = {At certain evolutionary junctures, two or more mutations participating in the build-up of a new complex function may be required to become available simultaneously in the same individuals. How could this happen in higher organisms whose populations are small compared to those of microbes, and in which chances of combined nearly simultaneous highly specific favorable mutations are correspondingly low? The question can in principle be answered for regulatory evolution, one of the basic processes of evolutionary change. A combined resetting of transcription rates in several genes could occur in the same individual. It is proposed that, in eukaryotes, changes in epigenetic trends and epigenetically transforming encounters between alternative chromatin structures could arise frequently enough so as to render probable particular conjunctions of changed transcription rates. Such conjunctions could involve mutational changes with low specificity requirements in gene-associated regions of non-protein-coding sequences. The effects of such mutations, notably when they determine the use of histone variants and covalent modifications of histones, can be among those that migrate along chromatin. Changes in chromatin structure are often cellularly inheritable over at least a limited number of generations of cells, and of individuals when the germ line is involved. {SINEs} and {LINEs}, which have been considered "junk {DNA}", are among the repeat sequences that would appear liable to have teleregulatory effects on the function of a nearby promoter, through changes in their numbers and distribution. There may also be present preexisting unstably inheritable epigenetic trends leading to cellular variegation, trends endemic in a cell population based on {DNA} sequences previously established in the neighborhood. Either way, epigenetically conditioned teleregulatory trends may display only limited penetrance. The imposition at a distance of new chromatin structures with regulatory impact can occur in cis as well as in trans, and is examined as intrachromosomally spreading teleregulation and interchromosomal "gene kissing". The chances for two or more particular epigenetically determined regulatory trends to occur together in a cell are increased thanks to the proposed low specificity requirements for most of the pertinent sequence changes in intergenic and intronic {DNA} or in the distribution of middle repetitive sequences that have teleregulatory impact. Inheritable epigenetic changes ("epimutations") with effects at a distance would then perdure over the number of generations required for "assimilation" of the several regulatory novelties through the occurrence and selection, gene by gene, of specific classical mutations. These mutations would have effects similar to the epigenetic effects, yet would provide stability and penetrance. The described epigenetic/genetic partnership may well at times have opened the way toward certain complex new functions. Thus, the presence of "junk {DNA}", through co-determining the (higher or lower) order and the variants of chromatin structure with regulatory effects at a distance, might make an important contribution to the evolution of complex organisms.}

abstract = {{DNA} methylation in the germline is among the most important factors influencing the evolution of mammalian genomes. Yet little is known about its evolutionary rate or the fraction of the methylome that has undergone change. We compared whole-genome, single-{CpG} {DNA} methylation profiles in sperm of seven species-human, chimpanzee, gorilla, rhesus macaque, mouse, rat, and dog-to investigate epigenomic evolution. We developed a phylo-epigenetic model for {DNA} methylation that accommodates the correlation of states at neighboring sites and allows for inference of ancestral states. Applying this model to the sperm methylomes, we uncovered an overall evolutionary expansion of the hypomethylated fraction of the genome, driven both by the birth of new hypomethylated regions and by extensive widening of hypomethylated intervals in ancestral species. This expansion shows strong lineage-specific aspects, most notably that hypomethylated intervals around transcription start sites have evolved to be considerably wider in primates and dog than in rodents, whereas rodents show evidence of a greater trend toward birth of new hypomethylated regions. Lineage-specific hypomethylated regions are enriched near sets of genes with common developmental functions and significant overlap across lineages. Rodent-specific and primate-specific hypomethylated regions are enriched for binding sites of similar transcription factors, suggesting that the plasticity accommodated by certain regulatory factors is conserved, despite substantial change in the specific sites of regulation. Overall our results reveal substantial global epigenomic change in mammalian sperm methylomes and point to a divergence in trans-epigenetic mechanisms that govern the organization of epigenetic states at gene promoters. \copyright 2018 Qu et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.}

We used 450k arrays and next-generation sequencing to evaluate intratumor heterogeneity and evolution of {DNA} methylation and genetic aberrations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia ({CLL}). {CLL} cases exhibit vast interpatient differences in intratumor methylation heterogeneity, with genetically clonal cases maintaining low methylation heterogeneity and up to 10\% of total {CpGs} in a monoallelically methylated state. Increasing methylation heterogeneity correlates with advanced genetic subclonal complexity. Selection of novel {DNA} methylation patterns is observed only in cases that undergo genetic evolution, and independent genetic evolution is uncommon and is restricted to low-risk alterations. These results reveal that although evolution of {DNA} methylation occurs in high-risk, clinically progressive cases, positive selection of novel methylation patterns entails coevolution of genetic alteration(s) in {CLL}.}

Histones {H2A}, {H2B}, H3, and H4 are composed of two common regions, the "histone fold" and the "histone tail". Many efforts have been focused on the mechanisms by which the post-translational modifications of histone tails regulate the higher-order chromatin architecture. On the other hand, previous biochemical studies have suggested that histone tails also affect the structure and stability of the nucleosome core particle itself. However, the precise contributions of each histone tail are unclear. In the present study, we determined the crystal structures of four mutant nucleosomes, in which one of the four histones, {H2A}, {H2B}, H3, or H4, lacked the N-terminal tail. We found that the deletion of the {H2B} or H3 N-terminal tail affected histone-{DNA} interactions and substantially decreased nucleosome stability. These findings provide important information for understanding the complex roles of histone tails in regulating chromatin structure.}

abstract = {To allow efficient transcript/gene detection, highly abundant ribosomal {RNAs} ({rRNA}) are generally removed from total {RNA} either by positive {polyA}+ selection or by {rRNA} depletion (negative selection) before sequencing. Comparisons between the two methods have been carried out by various groups, but the assessments have relied largely on non-clinical samples. In this study, we evaluated these two {RNA} sequencing approaches using human blood and colon tissue samples. Our analyses showed that {rRNA} depletion captured more unique transcriptome features, whereas {polyA}+ selection outperformed {rRNA} depletion with higher exonic coverage and better accuracy of gene quantification. For blood- and colon-derived {RNAs}, we found that 220\% and 50\% more reads, respectively, would have to be sequenced to achieve the same level of exonic coverage in the {rRNA} depletion method compared with the {polyA}+ selection method. Therefore, in most cases we strongly recommend {polyA}+ selection over {rRNA} depletion for gene quantification in clinical {RNA} sequencing. Our evaluation revealed that a small number of {lncRNAs} and small {RNAs} made up a large fraction of the reads in the {rRNA} depletion {RNA} sequencing data. Thus, we recommend that these {RNAs} are specifically depleted to improve the sequencing depth of the remaining {RNAs}.}

In rodents, this population is comprised of Asingle, Apaired and chains of 4-16 Aaligned spermatogonia. Although traditional models propose that the entire Asingle pool represents {\SSCs}, and formation of an Apaired syncytium symbolizes irreversible entry to a progenitor state destined for differentiation; recent models have emerged that suggest that the Asingle pool is heterogeneous, and Apaired/Aaligned can fragment to produce new {\SSCs}. In this review, we explore evidence from the literature for these differing models representing {\SSC} dynamics, including the traditional 'Asingle' and more recently formed 'fragmentation' models. Further, based on findings using a fluorescent reporter transgene ({eGfp}) that reflects expression of the {\SSC}-specific transcription factor 'inhibitor of {DNA} binding 4' (Id4), we propose a revised version of the traditional model in which {\SSCs} are a subset of the Asingle population; the {ID4}-{eGFP} bright cells ({\SSCultimate}). From the {\SSCultimate} pool, other Asingle and Apaired cohorts arise that are {ID4}-{eGFP} dim. Although the {\SSCultimate} possess a transcriptome profile that reflects a self-renewing state, the transcriptome of the {ID4}-{eGFP} dim population resembles that of cells in transition ({\SSCtransitory}) to a progenitor state. Accordingly, at the next mitotic division, these {\SSCtransitory} are likely to join the progenitor pool and have lost stem cell capacity. This model supports the concept of a linear relationship between spermatogonial chain length and propensity for differentiation, while leaving open the possibility that the {\SSCtransitory} (some Asingle and potentially some Apaired spermatogonia), may contribute to the self-renewing pool rather than transition to a progenitor state in response to perturbations of steady-state conditions. \copyright 2017 Society for Reproduction and Fertility.}

Since the 1950s, many experimental methods, including histology, immunostaining, whole-mount analyses, and pulse-chase labeling, had been used in attempts to identify {\SSCs}, but without success. In 1994, a spermatogonial transplantation method was reported that established a quantitative functional assay to identify {\SSCs} by evaluating their ability to both self-renew and differentiate to spermatozoa. The system was originally developed using mice and subsequently extended to nonrodents, including domestic animals and humans. Availability of the functional assay for {\SSCs} has made it possible to develop culture systems for their ex vivo expansion, which dramatically advanced germ cell biology and allowed medical and agricultural applications. In coming years, {\SSCs} will be increasingly used to understand their regulation, as well as in germline modification, including gene correction, enhancement of male fertility, and conversion of somatic cells to biologically competent male germline cells.}

Comparisons of gross levels of {DNA} methylation between distantly related species indicate that the size of the genome and the level of genomic {DNA} methylation are positively correlated. In plant genomes, this can be reliably explained by the genomic contents of repetitive sequences. In animal genomes, the role of repetitivfe sequences on genoimc {DNA} methylation is less clear. On a shorter timescale, population-level comparisons demonstrate that genetic variation can explain the observed variability of {DNA} methylation to some degree. The amount of {DNA} methylation variation that has been attributed to genetic variation in the human population studies so far is substantially lower than that from Arabidopsis population studies, but this disparity might reflect the differences in the computational and experimental techniques used. The effect of genetic variation on {DNA} methylation has been directly examined in mammalian systems, revealing several causative factors that govern {DNA} methylation. On the other hand, studies from Arabidopsis have furthered our understanding of spontaneous mutations of {DNA} methylation, termed "epimutations." Arabidopsis has an extremely high rate of spontaneous epimutations, which may play a major role in shaping the global {DNA} methylation landscape in this genome. Key missing information includes the frequencies of spontaneous epimutations in other lineages, in particular animal genomes, and how population-level variation of {DNA} methylation leads to species-level differences. \copyright The Author 2017.

abstract = {Compared to {RNA}-sequencing transcript differential analysis, gene-level differential expression analysis is more robust and experimentally actionable. However, the use of gene counts for statistical analysis can mask transcript-level dynamics. We demonstrate that 'analysis first, aggregation second,' where the p values derived from transcript analysis are aggregated to obtain gene-level results, increase sensitivity and accuracy. The method we propose can also be applied to transcript compatibility counts obtained from pseudoalignment of reads, which circumvents the need for quantification and is fast, accurate, and model-free. The method generalizes to various levels of biology and we showcase an application to gene ontologies.}

abstract = {The discovery of {RNAs} (for example, messenger {RNAs}, non-coding {RNAs}) in sperm has opened the possibility that sperm may function by delivering additional paternal information aside from solely providing the {DNA} 1 . Increasing evidence now suggests that sperm small non-coding {RNAs} ({sncRNAs}) can mediate intergenerational transmission of paternally acquired phenotypes, including mental stress2,3 and metabolic disorders4-6. How sperm {sncRNAs} encode paternal information remains unclear, but the mechanism may involve {RNA} modifications. Here we show that deletion of a mouse {tRNA} methyltransferase, {DNMT2}, abolished sperm {sncRNA}-mediated transmission of high-fat-diet-induced metabolic disorders to offspring. Dnmt2 deletion prevented the elevation of {RNA} modifications ({m5C}, {m2G}) in sperm 30-40 nt {RNA} fractions that are induced by a high-fat diet. Also, Dnmt2 deletion altered the sperm small {RNA} expression profile, including levels of {tRNA}-derived small {RNAs} and {rRNA}-derived small {RNAs}, which might be essential in composing a sperm {RNA} 'coding signature' that is needed for paternal epigenetic memory. Finally, we show that Dnmt2-mediated {m5C} contributes to the secondary structure and biological properties of {sncRNAs}, implicating sperm {RNA} modifications as an additional layer of paternal hereditary information.}

Since existing software and pipelines for {sRNA} annotation are mostly focused on analyzing {miRNAs} or {piRNAs}, here we developed the {sRNA} annotation pipelineoptimized for {rRNA}- and {tRNA}-derived {sRNAs} ({SPORTS1}.0). {SPORTS1}.0 is optimized for analyzing {tsRNAs} and {rsRNAs} from {sRNA}-seq data, in addition to its capacity to annotate canonical {sRNAs} such as {miRNAs} and {piRNAs}. Moreover, {SPORTS1}.0 can predict potential {RNA} modification sites based on nucleotide mismatches within {sRNAs}. {SPORTS1}.0 is precompiled to annotate {sRNAs} for a wide range of 68 species across bacteria, yeast, plant, and animal kingdoms, while additional species for analyses could be readily expanded upon end users' input. For demonstration, by analyzing {sRNA} datasets using {SPORTS1}.0, we reveal that distinct signatures are present in {tsRNAs} and {rsRNAs} from different mouse cell types. We also find that compared to other {sRNA} species, {tsRNAs} bear the highest mismatch rate, which is consistent with their highly modified nature. {SPORTS1}.0 is an open-source software and can be publically accessed at https://github.com/junchaoshi/sports1.0.

abstract = {With recent advances in sequencing technology, it is now feasible to measure {DNA} methylation at tens of millions of sites across the entire genome. In most applications, biologists are interested in detecting differentially methylated regions, composed of multiple sites with differing methylation levels among populations. However, current computational approaches for detecting such regions do not provide accurate statistical inference. A major challenge in reporting uncertainty is that a genome-wide scan is involved in detecting these regions, which needs to be accounted for. A further challenge is that sample sizes are limited due to the costs associated with the technology. We have developed a new approach that overcomes these challenges and assesses uncertainty for differentially methylated regions in a rigorous manner. Region-level statistics are obtained by fitting a generalized least squares regression model with a nested autoregressive correlated error structure for the effect of interest on transformed methylation proportions. We develop an inferential approach, based on a pooled null distribution, that can be implemented even when as few as two samples per population are available. Here, we demonstrate the advantages of our method using both experimental data and Monte Carlo simulation. We find that the new method improves the specificity and sensitivity of lists of regions and accurately controls the false discovery rate. \copyright The Author(s) 2018.

Today, most of genomes (animals and plants) allow the expression and accommodate transposition of a few transposon families. The potential genetic impact of this small fraction of mobile elements should not be underestimated. Although new insertions that happen in germ cells are likely to be passed to the next generation, mobilization in pluripotent embryonic stem cells or in somatic cells may contribute to the differences observed in genetic makeup and epigenetic gene regulation during development at the cellular level. The fact that these elements are still active, generating innovative ways to alter gene expression and genomic structure, suggests that the cellular genome is not static or deterministic but rather dynamic. In this short review, we collect a set of recent observations that point to a new appreciation of transposable elements as a source of genetic variation.}

Despite the repetitive nature, these transposable elements display quantitative and qualitative differences even among species of the same lineage. Although transposable elements contribute greatly as a driving force to the biological diversity during evolution, they can induce embryonic lethality and genetic disorders as a result of insertional mutagenesis and genomic rearrangement. Temporary relaxation of the epigenetic control of retrotransposons during early germline development opens a risky window that can allow retrotransposons to escape from host constraints and to propagate abundantly in the host genome. Because germline mutations caused by retrotransposon activation are heritable and thus can be deleterious to the offspring, an adaptive strategy has evolved in host cells, especially in the germline. In this review, we will attempt to summarize general defense mechanisms deployed by the eukaryotic genome, with an emphasis on pathways utilized by the male germline to confer retrotransposon silencing.}

Here we seek to quell the ambiguity of the name. First we place "epigenetic" in the various historical contexts. Then, by presenting the formal concepts of dynamical systems theory we show that the "epigenetic landscape" is more than a metaphor: it has specific mathematical foundations. The latter explains how gene regulatory networks produce multiple attractor states, the self-stabilizing patterns of gene activation across the genome that account for "epigenetic memory". This network dynamics approach replaces the reductionist correspondence of molecular epigenetic modifications with concept of the epigenetic landscape, by providing a concrete and crisp correspondence.}

We used a novel total {RNA} benchmarking dataset in which small non-coding {RNAs} are highly represented along with other long {RNAs}. The four {RNA}-seq pipelines consisted of two commonly-used alignment-free pipelines and two variants of alignment-based pipelines. We found that all pipelines showed high accuracy for quantifying the expression of long and highly-abundant genes. However, alignment-free pipelines showed systematically poorer performance in quantifying lowly-abundant and small {RNAs}. {CONCLUSION}: We have shown that alignment-free and traditional alignment-based quantification methods perform similarly for common gene targets, such as protein-coding genes.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Count data generated by next-generation sequencing assays do not measure absolute transcript abundances. Instead, the data are constrained to an arbitrary "library size" by the sequencing depth of the assay, and typically must be normalized prior to statistical analysis. The constrained nature of these data means one could alternatively use a log-ratio transformation in lieu of normalization, as often done when testing for differential abundance ({DA}) of operational taxonomic units ({OTUs}) in {16S} {rRNA} data. Therefore, we benchmark how well the {ALDEx2} package, a transformation-based {DA} tool, detects differential expression in high-throughput {RNA}-sequencing data ({RNA}-Seq), compared to conventional {RNA}-Seq methods such as {edgeR} and {DESeq2}. {RESULTS}: To evaluate the performance of log-ratio transformation-based tools, we apply the {ALDEx2} package to two simulated, and two real, {RNA}-Seq data sets. One of the latter was previously used to benchmark dozens of conventional {RNA}-Seq differential expression methods, enabling us to directly compare transformation-based approaches. We show that {ALDEx2}, widely used in meta-genomics research, identifies differentially expressed genes (and transcripts) from {RNA}-Seq data with high precision and, given sufficient sample sizes, high recall too (regardless of the alignment and quantification procedure used). Although we show that the choice in log-ratio transformation can affect performance, {ALDEx2} has high precision (i.e., few false positives) across all transformations. Finally, we present a novel, iterative log-ratio transformation (now implemented in {ALDEx2}) that further improves performance in simulations. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our results suggest that log-ratio transformation-based methods can work to measure differential expression from {RNA}-Seq data, provided that certain assumptions are met. Moreover, these methods have very high precision (i.e., few false positives) in simulations and perform well on real data too. With previously demonstrated applicability to {16S} {rRNA} data, {ALDEx2} can thus serve as a single tool for data from multiple sequencing modalities.}

We generated zygotes via intracytoplasmic sperm injection ({ICSI}) using sperm obtained from the proximal (caput) versus distal (cauda) epididymis and then characterized the development of the resulting embryos. Embryos generated using caput sperm significantly overexpress multiple regulatory factors throughout preimplantation development, subsequently implant inefficiently, and fail soon after implantation. Remarkably, microinjection of purified cauda-specific small {RNAs} into caput-derived embryos not only completely rescued preimplantation molecular defects but also suppressed the post-implantation embryonic lethality phenotype. These findings reveal an essential role for small {RNA} remodeling during post-testicular maturation of mammalian sperm and identify a specific preimplantation gene expression program responsive to sperm-delivered {microRNAs}.

To perform this role, the stem cell must self replicate as well as produce daughter cells that can expand and differentiate to form spermatozoa. Despite the central importance of the spermatogonial stem cell to male reproduction, little is known about its morphological or biochemical characteristics. This results, in part, from the fact that spermatogonial stem cells are an extremely rare cell population in the testis, and techniques for their enrichment are just beginning to be established. In this investigation, we used a multiparameter selection strategy, combining the in vivo cryptorchid testis model with in vitro fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Cryptorchid testis cells were fractionated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis based on light-scattering properties and expression of the cell surface molecules alpha6-integrin, alphav-integrin, and the c-kit receptor. Two important observations emerged from these analyses. First, spermatogonial stem cells from the adult cryptorchid testis express little or no c-kit. Second, the most effective enrichment strategy, in this study, selected cells with low side scatter light-scattering properties, positive staining for alpha6-integrin, and negative or low alphav-integrin expression, and resulted in a 166-fold enrichment of spermatogonial stem cells. Identification of these characteristics will allow further purification of these valuable cells and facilitate the investigation of molecular mechanisms governing spermatogonial stem cell self renewal and hierarchical differentiation.}

With rapidly increasing numbers of small {RNAs} listed in recent years, we have come to realize how widespread their functions are and how diverse the biogenesis pathways have evolved. At the same time, we are beginning to grasp the common features and rules governing the key steps in small {RNA} pathways.

abstract = {Spermatogenesis requires intricate interactions between the germline and somatic cells. Within a given cross section of a seminiferous tubule, multiple germ and somatic cell types co-occur. This cellular heterogeneity has made it difficult to profile distinct cell types at different stages of development. To address this challenge, we collected single-cell {RNA} sequencing data from ∼35,000 cells from the adult mouse testis and identified all known germ and somatic cells, as well as two unexpected somatic cell types. Our analysis revealed a continuous developmental trajectory of germ cells from spermatogonia to spermatids and identified candidate transcriptional regulators at several transition points during differentiation. Focused analyses delineated four subtypes of spermatogonia and nine subtypes of Sertoli cells; the latter linked to histologically defined developmental stages over the seminiferous epithelial cycle. Overall, this high-resolution cellular atlas represents a community resource and foundation of knowledge to study germ cell development and in vivo gametogenesis.

However, growing evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms, such as {DNA} methylation, may also be involved in rapid adaptation to new environments. An important first step in evaluating this hypothesis is to test for the presence of epigenetic variation between natural populations living under different environmental conditions. {RESULTS}: In the current study we explored variation between populations of Darwin's finches, which comprise one of the best-studied examples of adaptive radiation. We tested for morphological, genetic, and epigenetic differences between adjacent "urban" and "rural" populations of each of two species of ground finches, Geospiza fortis and G. fuliginosa, on Santa Cruz Island in the Galápagos. Using data collected from more than 1000 birds, we found significant morphological differences between populations of G. fortis, but not G. fuliginosa. We did not find large size copy number variation ({CNV}) genetic differences between populations of either species. However, other genetic variants were not investigated. In contrast, we did find dramatic epigenetic differences between the urban and rural populations of both species, based on {DNA} methylation analysis. We explored genomic features and gene associations of the differentially {DNA} methylated regions ({DMR}), as well as their possible functional significance. {CONCLUSIONS}: In summary, our study documents local population epigenetic variation within each of two species of Darwin's finches.}

In addition, 3' {UTRs} can establish 3' {UTR}-mediated protein-protein interactions ({PPIs}), and thus can transmit genetic information encoded in 3' {UTRs} to proteins. This function has been shown to regulate diverse protein features, including protein complex formation or posttranslational modifications, but is also expected to alter protein conformations. Therefore, 3' {UTR}-mediated information transfer can regulate protein features that are not encoded in the amino acid sequence. This review summarizes both 3' {UTR} functions-the regulation of {mRNA} and protein-based processes-and highlights how each 3' {UTR} function was discovered with a focus on experimental approaches used and the concepts that were learned. This review also discusses novel approaches to study 3' {UTR} functions in the future by taking advantage of recent advances in technology.

abstract = {Attaching Unique Molecular Identifiers ({UMI}) to {RNA} molecules in the first step of sequencing library preparation establishes a distinct identity for each input molecule. This makes it possible to eliminate the effects of {PCR} amplification bias, which is particularly important where many {PCR} cycles are required, for example, in single cell studies. After {PCR}, molecules sharing a {UMI} are assumed to be derived from the same input molecule. In our single cell {RNA}-Seq studies of Physcomitrella patens, we discovered that reads sharing a {UMI}, and therefore presumed to be derived from the same {mRNA} molecule, frequently map to different, but closely spaced locations. This behaviour occurs in all such libraries that we have produced, and in multiple other {UMI}-containing {RNA}-Seq data sets in the public domain. This apparent paradox, that reads of identical origin map to distinct genomic coordinates may be partially explained by {PCR} stutter, which is often seen in low-entropy templates and those containing simple tandem repeats. In the absence of {UMI} this artefact is undetectable. We show that the common assumption that sequence reads having different mapping coordinates are derived from different starting molecules does not hold. Unless taken into account, this artefact is likely to result in over-estimation of certain transcript abundances, depending on the counting method employed.}

abstract = {Traditionally, it has been widely acknowledged that genes together with adult lifestyle factors determine the risk of developing some metabolic diseases such as insulin resistance, obesity and diabetes mellitus in later life. However, there is now substantial evidence that prenatal and early-postnatal nutrition play a critical role in determining susceptibility to these diseases in later life. Maternal nutrition has historically been a key determinant for offspring health, and gestation is the critical time window that can affect the growth and development of offspring. The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease ({DOHaD}) hypothesis proposes that exposures during early life play a critical role in determining the risk of developing metabolic diseases in adulthood. Currently, there are substantial epidemiological studies and experimental animal models that have demonstrated that nutritional disturbances during the critical periods of early-life development can significantly have an impact on the predisposition to developing some metabolic diseases in later life. The hypothesis that epigenetic mechanisms may link imbalanced early-life nutrition with altered disease risk has been widely accepted in recent years. Epigenetics can be defined as the study of heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations in the {DNA} sequence. Epigenetic processes play a significant role in regulating tissue-specific gene expression, and hence alterations in these processes may induce long-term changes in gene function and metabolism that persist throughout the life course. The present review focuses on how nutrition in early life can alter the epigenome, produce different phenotypes and alter disease susceptibilities, especially for impaired glucose metabolism.}

Some vasovasostomized men experience a reduced fertility outcome. {STUDY} {DESIGN}, {SIZE}, {DURATION}: Human epididymides provided by three control donors and three vasectomized donors were collected under artificial circulation through Transplant Quebec (Quebec, {QC}, Canada). Semen from three normal, three vasectomized and five vasovasostomized donors was provided by the andrology clinic. {PARTICIPANTS}/{MATERIALS}, {SETTING}, {METHODS}: Epididymides and semen were collected from donors between 26 and 50 years of age with no known pathologies that could potentially affect reproductive function. After {RNA} extraction, epididymal {miRNA} profiles were determined by microarray (Affimetrix), compared by {ANOVA} and confirmed by real-time {PCR}. The correlation between {miRNA} and gene expression profiles was investigated by an integrated genomic approach. {miRNA} signature from purified {SMVs} was established by microarray. {MAIN} {RESULTS} {AND} {THE} {ROLE} {OF} {CHANCE}: Vasectomy significantly modified the expression of epididymal {miRNAs}, which were mainly correlated with {mRNAs} for transcription factors. Vasectomy also impacted the detection of 118 of the {miRNAs} found in {SMVs} from normal donors, including {miRNAs} of epididymal origin contained in epididymosomes. Among seminal {miRNAs} changes, 52 were reversible according to the expression levels of {miRNA} in the semen samples from vasovasostomized donors, while 66 were non-reversible. {LIMITATIONS}, {REASONS} {FOR} {CAUTION}: Identification of {miRNAs} responsive to vasectomy was determined with a limited number of samples due to the low number of human specimen samples available. {WIDER} {IMPLICATIONS} {OF} {THE} {FINDINGS}: According to the critical role played by {miRNAs} in all biological systems, we believe that {miRNA} changes occurring upstream and downstream of the vasectomy site may be related to the reduced fertility outcome reported following surgically successful vasectomy reversal. This study may provide new tools for predicting vasovasostomy success and open avenues for the identification of the molecular players involved in male infertility.}

In the case of {RNA}-Seq, transcriptome pseudoalignment of reads is a fast alternative to genome alignment, but the different coordinate systems of the genome and transcriptome have made it difficult to perform direct comparisons between the approaches. Results: We have developed tools for converting genome alignments to transcriptome pseudoalignments, and conversely, for projecting transcriptome pseudoalignments to genome alignments. Using these tools, we performed a direct comparison of genome alignment with transcriptome pseudoalignment. We find that both approaches produce similar quantifications. This means that for many applications genome alignment and transcriptome pseudoalignment are interchangeable.

It is, therefore, a particularly promising time to revisit how metabolism can affect multiple aspects of animal development. In this Review, we discuss how metabolism is mechanistically linked to cellular and developmental programs through both its bioenergetic and metabolic signaling functions. We highlight how metabolism is regulated across various spatial and temporal scales, and discuss how this regulation can influence cellular processes such as cell signaling, gene expression, and epigenetic and post-translational modifications during embryonic development. \copyright 2018.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: One explanation for the persistence of schizophrenia despite the reduced fertility of patients is that it is a by-product of recent human evolution. This hypothesis is supported by evidence suggesting that recently-evolved genomic regions in humans are involved in the genetic risk for schizophrenia. Using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}) of schizophrenia and 11 other phenotypes, we tested for enrichment of association with {GWAS} traits in regions that have undergone methylation changes in the human lineage compared to Neanderthals and Denisovans, i.e. human-specific differentially methylated regions ({DMRs}). We used analytical tools that evaluate polygenic enrichment of a subset of genomic variants against all variants. {RESULTS}: Schizophrenia was the only trait in which {DMR} {SNPs} showed clear enrichment of association that passed the genome-wide significance threshold. The enrichment was not observed for Neanderthal or Denisovan {DMRs}. The enrichment seen in human {DMRs} is comparable to that for genomic regions tagged by Neanderthal Selective Sweep markers, and stronger than that for Human Accelerated Regions. The enrichment survives multiple testing performed through permutation (n = 10,000) and bootstrapping (n = 5000) in {INRICH} (p \textless  0.01). Some enrichment of association with height was observed at the gene level. {CONCLUSIONS}: Regions where {DNA} methylation modifications have changed during recent human evolution show enrichment of association with schizophrenia and possibly with height. Our study further supports the hypothesis that genetic variants conferring risk of schizophrenia co-occur in genomic regions that have changed as the human species evolved. Since methylation is an epigenetic mark, potentially mediated by environmental changes, our results also suggest that interaction with the environment might have contributed to that association.}

abstract = {Small {RNAs} are short (approximately 18 to 30 nucleotides), non-coding {RNA} molecules that can regulate gene expression in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus via post-transcriptional gene silencing ({PTGS}), chromatin-dependent gene silencing ({CDGS}) or {RNA} activation ({RNAa}). Three classes of small {RNAs} have been defined: {microRNAs} ({miRNAs}), {siRNAs} and Piwi-interacting {RNAs} ({piRNAs}). Research has indicated that small {RNAs} play important roles in cellular processes such as cell differentiation, growth/proliferation, migration, apoptosis/death, metabolism and defense. Accordingly, small {RNAs} are critical regulators of normal development and physiology. More interestingly, increasing evidence indicates that small {RNAs} are involved in the pathogenesis of diverse diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, stroke, neurodegenerative disease, diabetes, liver disease, kidney disease and infectious disease. More than 20 clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate therapies based on small {RNA}. Additionally, small {RNAs} may serve as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the majority of diseases.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: {RNA}-seq and small {RNA}-seq are powerful, quantitative tools to study gene regulation and function. Common high-throughput sequencing methods rely on polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}) to expand the starting material, but not every molecule amplifies equally, causing some to be overrepresented. Unique molecular identifiers ({UMIs}) can be used to distinguish undesirable {PCR} duplicates derived from a single molecule and identical but biologically meaningful reads from different molecules. {RESULTS}: We have incorporated {UMIs} into {RNA}-seq and small {RNA}-seq protocols and developed tools to analyze the resulting data. Our {UMIs} contain stretches of random nucleotides whose lengths sufficiently capture diverse molecule species in both {RNA}-seq and small {RNA}-seq libraries generated from mouse testis. Our approach yields high-quality data while allowing unique tagging of all molecules in high-depth libraries. {CONCLUSIONS}: Using simulated and real datasets, we demonstrate that our methods increase the reproducibility of {RNA}-seq and small {RNA}-seq data. Notably, we find that the amount of starting material and sequencing depth, but not the number of {PCR} cycles, determine {PCR} duplicate frequency. Finally, we show that computational removal of {PCR} duplicates based only on their mapping coordinates introduces substantial bias into data analysis.}

Synonymous and intronic mutations with predicted splice-altering consequence validate at a high rate on {RNA}-seq and are strongly deleterious in the human population. De novo mutations with predicted splice-altering consequence are significantly enriched in patients with autism and intellectual disability compared to healthy controls and validate against {RNA}-seq in 21 out of 28 of these patients.

The organization of accessible chromatin across the genome reflects a network of permissible physical interactions through which enhancers, promoters, insulators and chromatin-binding factors cooperatively regulate gene expression. This landscape of accessibility changes dynamically in response to both external stimuli and developmental cues, and emerging evidence suggests that homeostatic maintenance of accessibility is itself dynamically regulated through a competitive interplay between chromatin-binding factors and nucleosomes. In this Review, we examine how the accessible genome is measured and explore the role of transcription factors in initiating accessibility remodelling; our goal is to illustrate how chromatin accessibility defines regulatory elements within the genome and how these epigenetic features are dynamically established to control gene expression.}

abstract = {Despite a wealth of molecular knowledge, quantitative laws for accurate prediction of biological phenomena remain rare. Alternative pre-{mRNA} splicing is an important regulated step in gene expression frequently perturbed in human disease. To understand the combined effects of mutations during evolution, we quantified the effects of all possible combinations of exonic mutations accumulated during the emergence of an alternatively spliced human exon. This revealed that mutation effects scale non-monotonically with the inclusion level of an exon, with each mutation having maximum effect at a predictable intermediate inclusion level. This scaling is observed genome-wide for cis and trans perturbations of splicing, including for natural and disease-associated variants. Mathematical modeling suggests that competition between alternative splice sites is sufficient to cause this non-linearity in the genotype-phenotype map. Combining the global scaling law with specific pairwise interactions between neighboring mutations allows accurate prediction of the effects of complex genotype changes involving \textgreater10 mutations.

The significance of {DNA} methylation to the evolution of developmental complexity in plants lies in its role in the management of developmental pathways. As such it is more important in fine tuning the presence, absence, and placement of organs rather than having a central role in the evolution of new organs. Nevertheless, its importance should not be underestimated as it contributes considerably to the range of phenotypic expression and complexity available to plants: the subject of the emerging field of epi-evodevo. Furthermore, changes in {DNA} methylation can function as a "soft" mutation that may be important in the early stages of major evolutionary novelty.}

Among all the epigenetic modifications, {DNA} methylation perturbations have been the most widely studied in {SLE}. It mediates processes relevant to {SLE}, including lymphocyte development, X-chromosome inactivation and the suppression of endogenous retroviruses. The establishment of most {DNA} methylation marks occurs in utero; however, a small percentage of epigenetic marks are dynamic and can change throughout a person's lifetime and in relation to exposures. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the biology of {DNA} methylation and its regulators, the measurement and interpretation of methylation marks, the effects of genetics on {DNA} methylation and the role of environmental exposures with relevance to {SLE}. We also summarise research findings associated with {SLE} disease risk and heterogeneity. The robust finding of hypomethylation of interferon-responsive genes in patients with {SLE} and new associations beyond interferon-responsive genes such as cell-specific methylation abnormalities are described. We also discuss methylation changes associated with lupus nephritis, autoantibody status and disease activity. Lastly, we explore future research directions, emphasising the need for longitudinal studies, cell tissue and context-specific profiling, as well as integrative approaches. With new technologies, {DNA} methylation perturbations could be targeted and edited, offering novel therapeutic approaches.}

In humans, pioneer studies showed that exposure to famine, endocrine disruptors or trauma can affect descendants, and has led to a paradigm shift in thinking about heredity. Studies in humans have however been limited by the low number of successive generations, the different conditions that can be examined, and the lack of mechanistic insight they can provide. Animal models have been instrumental to circumvent these limitations and allowed studies on the mechanisms of inheritance of environmentally induced traits across generations in controlled and reproducible settings. However, most models available today are only intergenerational and do not demonstrate transmission beyond the direct offspring of exposed individuals. Here, we report transgenerational transmission of behavioral and metabolic phenotypes up to the 4th generation in a mouse model of paternal postnatal trauma ({MSUS}). Based on large animal numbers (up to 124 per group) from several independent breedings conducted 10 years apart by different experimenters, we show that depressive-like behaviors are transmitted to the offspring until the third generation, and risk-taking and glucose dysregulation until the fourth generation via males. The symptoms are consistent and reproducible, and persist with similar severity across generations. These results provide strong evidence that adverse conditions in early postnatal life can have transgenerational effects, and highlight the validity of {MSUS} as a solid model of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.}

Recent work highlights the importance of investigating genome-wide changes in splicing patterns and the subsequent functional consequences. Current computational methods only support such analysis on a gene-by-gene basis. Therefore, we extended {IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR} R library to enable analysis of genome-wide changes in specific types of alternative splicing and predicted functional consequences of the resulting isoform switches. As a case study, we analyzed {RNA}-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and found systematic changes in alternative splicing and the consequences of the associated isoform switches. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: Windows, Linux and Mac {OS}: http://bioconductor.org/packages/{IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR}. {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. \copyright The Author(s) 2019.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Reproducibility of a research is a key element in the modern science and it is mandatory for any industrial application. It represents the ability of replicating an experiment independently by the location and the operator. Therefore, a study can be considered reproducible only if all used data are available and the exploited computational analysis workflow is clearly described. However, today for reproducing a complex bioinformatics analysis, the raw data and the list of tools used in the workflow could be not enough to guarantee the reproducibility of the results obtained. Indeed, different releases of the same tools and/or of the system libraries (exploited by such tools) might lead to sneaky reproducibility issues. {RESULTS}: To address this challenge, we established the Reproducible Bioinformatics Project ({RBP}), which is a non-profit and open-source project, whose aim is to provide a schema and an infrastructure, based on docker images and R package, to provide reproducible results in Bioinformatics. One or more Docker images are then defined for a workflow (typically one for each task), while the workflow implementation is handled via R-functions embedded in a package available at github repository. Thus, a bioinformatician participating to the project has firstly to integrate her/his workflow modules into Docker image(s) exploiting an Ubuntu docker image developed ad hoc by {RPB} to make easier this task. Secondly, the workflow implementation must be realized in R according to an R-skeleton function made available by {RPB} to guarantee homogeneity and reusability among different {RPB} functions. Moreover she/he has to provide the R vignette explaining the package functionality together with an example dataset which can be used to improve the user confidence in the workflow utilization. {CONCLUSIONS}: Reproducible Bioinformatics Project provides a general schema and an infrastructure to distribute robust and reproducible workflows. Thus, it guarantees to final users the ability to repeat consistently any analysis independently by the used {UNIX}-like architecture.}

Both the embryonic and extraembryonic lineages of the early mouse embryo have seemingly co-opted {TEs} as enhancers, but there is little evidence that they play significant roles in gene regulation. Here we tested a set of long terminal repeat {TE} families for roles as enhancers in mouse embryonic and trophoblast stem cells. Epigenomic and transcriptomic data suggested that a large number of {TEs} helped to establish tissue-specific gene expression programmes. Genetic editing of individual {TEs} confirmed a subset of these regulatory relationships. However, a wider survey via {CRISPR} interference of {RLTR13D6} elements in embryonic stem cells revealed that only a minority play significant roles in gene regulation. Our results suggest that a subset of {TEs} are important for gene regulation in early mouse development, and highlight the importance of functional experiments when evaluating gene regulatory roles of {TEs}. \copyright 2019, Todd et al.}

abstract = {The specific post-translational modifications of the histone proteins are associated with specific {DNA}-templated processes, such as transcriptional activation or repression. To investigate the biological role(s) of histone H4 lysine 20 (H4 Lys-20) methylation, we created a novel panel of antibodies that specifically detected mono-, di-, or trimethylated H4 Lys-20. We report that the different methylated forms of H4 Lys-20 are compartmentalized within visually distinct, transcriptionally silent regions in the mammalian nucleus. Interestingly, direct comparison of methylated H4 Lys-20 with the different methylated states of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3 Lys-9) revealed significant overlap and exclusion between the specific groups of methyl modifications. Trimethylated H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 were both selectively enriched within pericentric heterochromatin. Similarly, monomethylated H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 partitioned together and the dimethylated forms partitioned together within the chromosome arms; however, the mono- and dimethylated modifications were virtually exclusive. These findings strongly suggest that the combinatorial presence or absence of the different methylated states of H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 define particular types of silent chromatin. Consistent with this, detailed analysis of monomethylated H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 revealed that both were preferentially and selectively enriched within the same nucleosome particle in vivo. Collectively, these findings define a novel trans-tail histone code involving monomethylated H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 that act cooperatively to mark distinct regions of silent chromatin within the mammalian epigenome.}

Sperm distal {ATAC}-seq sites containing motifs for various transcription factors are conserved in monkeys and humans. {ChIP}-seq analyses confirm that Foxa1, {ER\alpha}, and {AR} occupy distal enhancers in sperm. Accessible sperm enhancers containing H3.3 and {H2A}.Z are also accessible in oocytes and preimplantation embryos. Furthermore, their interactions with promoters in the gametes persist during early development. Sperm- or oocyte-specific interactions mediated by {CTCF} and cohesin are only present in the paternal or maternal chromosomes, respectively, in the zygote and 2-cell stages. These interactions converge in both chromosomes by the 8-cell stage. Thus, mammalian gametes contain complex patterns of {3D} interactions that can be transmitted to the zygote after fertilization.

Using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, we have compared the methylomes of neuronal and non-neuronal cells from 3 human and 3 chimpanzee cortices. Differentially methylated regions ({DMRs}) with genome-wide significance were enriched in specific genomic regions. Intraspecific methylation differences between neuronal and non-neuronal cells were approximately 3 times more abundant than interspecific methylation differences between human and chimpanzee cell types. The vast majority (\textgreater90\%) of human intraspecific {DMRs} (including {DMRs} in retrotransposons) were hypomethylated in neurons, compared with glia. Intraspecific {DMRs} were enriched in genes associated with different neuropsychiatric disorders. Interspecific {DMRs} were enriched in genes showing human-specific brain histone modifications. Human-chimpanzee methylation differences were much more frequent in non-neuronal cells (n. {DMRs} = 666) than in neurons (n. {DMRs} = 96). More than 95\% of interspecific {DMRs} in glia were hypermethylated in humans. Although without an outgroup we cannot assign whether a change in methylation occurred in the human or chimpanzee lineage, our results are consistent with a wave of methylation affecting several hundred non-neuronal genes during human brain evolution.}

These are fundamental questions at the forefront of our evolutionary epigenomic understanding. Our previous work investigated human and chimpanzee brain methylomes, but it was limited by the lack of outgroup data which is critical for comparative (epi)genomic studies. Here, we compared whole genome {DNA} methylation maps from brains of humans, chimpanzees and also rhesus macaques (outgroup) to elucidate {DNA} methylation changes during human brain evolution. Moreover, we validated that our approach is highly robust by further examining 38 human-specific {DMRs} using targeted deep genomic and bisulfite sequencing in an independent panel of 37 individuals from five primate species. Our unbiased genome-scan identified human brain differentially methylated regions ({DMRs}), irrespective of their associations with annotated genes. Remarkably, over half of the newly identified {DMRs} locate in intergenic regions or gene bodies. Nevertheless, their regulatory potential is on par with those of promoter {DMRs}. An intriguing observation is that {DMRs} are enriched in active chromatin loops, suggesting human-specific evolutionary remodeling at a higher-order chromatin structure. These findings indicate that there is substantial reprogramming of epigenomic landscapes during human brain evolution involving noncoding regions. \copyright The Author 2016.

Stress is a major aspect of natural selection in the wild, leading to changes in the transcriptional regulation of a variety of genes that are often triggered by one or a few transcription factors. In this work, we take advantage of the wealth of information available for Drosophila melanogaster and humans to analyze the role of transposable elements in six stress regulatory networks: immune, hypoxia, oxidative, xenobiotic, heat shock, and heavy metal. We found that transposable elements were enriched for caudal, dorsal, {HSF}, and tango binding sites in D. melanogaster and for {NFE2L2} binding sites in humans. Taking into account the D. melanogaster population frequencies of transposable elements with predicted binding motifs and/or binding sites, we showed that those containing three or more binding motifs/sites are more likely to be functional. For a representative subset of these {TEs}, we performed in vivo transgenic reporter assays in different stress conditions. Overall, our results showed that {TEs} are relevant contributors to the transcriptional regulation of stress-response genes. \copyright The Author(s) 2019.

It integrates read mapping and quantification in a single package and has no software dependencies other than R itself. We demonstrate Rsubread's ability to detect exon-exon junctions de novo and to quantify expression at the level of either genes, exons or exon junctions. The resulting read counts can be input directly into a wide range of downstream statistical analyses using other Bioconductor packages. Using {SEQC} data and simulations, we compare Rsubread to {TopHat2}, {STAR} and {HTSeq} as well as to counting functions in the Bioconductor infrastructure packages. We consider the performance of these tools on the combined quantification task starting from raw sequence reads through to summary counts, and in particular evaluate the performance of different combinations of alignment and counting algorithms.

This suggests that {piRNA} function might be broader than previously expected. Here, we show that different {piRNA} databases contain a subset of sequences that correspond to {piRNA}-sized fragments of {ncRNAs} ({rRNAs}, {tRNAs}, {YRNAs}, {snRNAs}, and {snoRNAs}) and intermediates of {miRNA} biogenesis.

By contrast, the repressive mark {H3K27me3} undergoes global depletion. {CpG}-rich regulatory regions then resolve to either active or repressed states upon {ZGA}, followed by subsequent restoration of {H3K27me3} at developmental genes. Finally, by combining chromatin and transcriptome maps, we revealed transcription circuitry and asymmetric {H3K27me3} patterning during early lineage specification. Collectively, our data unveil a priming phase connecting human parental-to-zygotic epigenetic transition. Copyright \copyright 2019, American Association for the Advancement of Science.}

This review will detail current knowledge of these three processes both at the genome-wide level and at specific imprinted loci. The consequences of epigenetic perturbation are discussed and new in vitro models which may allow further understanding of a difficult developmental period to study, especially in the human, are highlighted.}

The ready availability of multi-omics datasets has led to the development of numerous methods for identifying sources of common variation across biological modalities. However, evaluation of the performance of these methods, in terms of consistency, has been difficult because most methods are unsupervised. We present a comparison of sparse multiple canonical correlation analysis (Sparse {mCCA}), angle-based joint and individual variation explained ({AJIVE}) and multi-omics factor analysis ({MOFA}) using a cross-validation approach to assess overfitting and consistency. Both large and small-sample datasets were used to evaluate performance, and a permuted null dataset was used to identify overfitting through the application of our framework and approach. In the large-sample setting, we found that all methods demonstrated consistency and lack of overfitting; however, in the small-sample size setting, {AJIVE} provided the most stable results. We provide an R package so that our framework and approach can be applied to evaluate other methods and datasets. \copyright The authors 2019.

Here, we set the scene for recent discoveries by reviewing the major events of neural development during fetal life, with an emphasis on tissues and structures where dynamic methylation changes are known to occur.

abstract = {Background: {RNA} sequencing has enabled high-throughput and fine-grained quantitative analyses of the transcriptome. While differential gene expression is the most widely used application of this technology, {RNA}-seq data also has the resolution to infer differential transcript usage ({DTU}), which can elucidate the role of different transcript isoforms between experimental conditions, cell types or tissues. {DTU} has typically been inferred from exon-count data, which has issues with assigning reads unambiguously to counting bins, and requires alignment of reads to the genome. Recently, approaches have emerged that use transcript quantification estimates directly for {DTU}. Transcript counts can be inferred from 'pseudo' or lightweight aligners, which are significantly faster than traditional genome alignment. However, recent evaluations show lower sensitivity in {DTU} analysis compared to exon-level analysis. Transcript abundances are estimated from equivalence classes ({ECs}), which determine the transcripts that any given read is compatible with. Recent work has proposed performing a variety of {RNA}-seq analysis directly on equivalence class counts ({ECCs}). Methods: Here we demonstrate that {ECCs} can be used effectively with existing count-based methods for detecting {DTU}. We evaluate this approach on simulated human and drosophila data, as well as on a real dataset through subset testing. Results: We find that {ECCs} have similar sensitivity and false discovery rates as exon-level counts but can be generated in a fraction of the time through the use of pseudo-aligners. Conclusions: We posit that equivalence class read counts are a natural unit on which to perform differential transcript usage analysis.}

abstract = {A primary challenge in the analysis of {RNA}-seq data is to identify differentially expressed genes or transcripts while controlling for technical biases. Ideally, a statistical testing procedure should incorporate the inherent uncertainty of the abundance estimates arising from the quantification step. Most popular methods for {RNA}-seq differential expression analysis fit a parametric model to the counts for each gene or transcript, and a subset of methods can incorporate uncertainty. Previous work has shown that nonparametric models for {RNA}-seq differential expression may have better control of the false discovery rate, and adapt well to new data types without requiring reformulation of a parametric model. Existing nonparametric models do not take into account inferential uncertainty, leading to an inflated false discovery rate, in particular at the transcript level. We propose a nonparametric model for differential expression analysis using inferential replicate counts, extending the existing {SAMseq} method to account for inferential uncertainty. We compare our method, Swish, with popular differential expression analysis methods. Swish has improved control of the false discovery rate, in particular for transcripts with high inferential uncertainty. We apply Swish to a single-cell {RNA}-seq dataset, assessing differential expression between sub-populations of cells, and compare its performance to the Wilcoxon test. \copyright The Author(s) 2019.

A constraint on information loss determines the size of the reduced dataset. Simulation studies demonstrate that when multiple related features are associated with a response, this approach can substantially increase the number of true associations detected as compared to principal components analysis, non-negative matrix factorization or no {DR}. This increase in true discoveries is explained both by a reduced multiple-testing challenge and a reduction in extraneous noise.

To become functional, {tRNAs}, initially transcribed as longer precursor {tRNAs}, undergo a tightly controlled biogenesis process comprising the maturation of their extremities, removal of intronic sequences if present, addition of the 3'-{CCA} amino-acid accepting sequence, and aminoacylation. In addition, the most impressive feature of {tRNA} biogenesis consists in the incorporation of a large number of posttranscriptional chemical modifications along its sequence. The chemical nature of these modifications is highly diverse, with more than hundred different modifications identified in {tRNAs} to date. All functions of {tRNAs} in cells are controlled and modulated by modifications, making the understanding of the mechanisms that determine and influence nucleotide modifications in {tRNAs} an essential point in {tRNA} biology. This review describes the different aspects that determine whether a certain position in a {tRNA} molecule is modified or not. We describe how sequence and structural determinants, as well as the presence of prior modifications control modification processes. We also describe how environmental factors and cellular stresses influence the level and/or the nature of certain modifications introduced in {tRNAs}, and report situations where these dynamic modulations of {tRNA} modification levels are regulated by active demodification processes. \copyright 2019 {IUBMB} Life, 71(8):1126-1140, 2019. \copyright 2019 The Authors. {IUBMB} Life published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.}

These studies have been complemented by efforts directed at defining sequence codes governing splicing and their cognate trans-acting factors, which have illuminated important combinatorial principles of regulation. Additional studies have revealed critical roles of position-dependent, multivalent protein-{RNA} interactions that direct splicing outcomes. Investigations of evolutionary changes in {RNA} binding proteins, splice variants, and associated cis elements have further shed light on the emergence, mechanisms, and functions of splicing networks.

However, accessing the localized strategies preserving chromatin domain inheritance, specifically the transfer of parental, pre-existing nucleosomes with their associated post-translational modifications ({PTMs}) during {DNA} replication, is challenging in living cells. We devised an inducible, proximity-dependent labeling system to irreversibly mark replication-dependent H3.1 and H3.2 histone-containing nucleosomes at desired loci in mouse embryonic stem cells so that their fate after {DNA} replication could be followed. Strikingly, repressed chromatin domains are preserved through local re-deposition of parental nucleosomes. In contrast, nucleosomes decorating active chromatin domains do not exhibit such preservation. Notably, altering cell fate leads to an adjustment of the positional inheritance of parental nucleosomes that reflects the corresponding changes in chromatin structure. These findings point to important mechanisms that contribute to parental nucleosome segregation to preserve cellular identity. Copyright \copyright 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}

Currently, scientists tend to assume coding genes are functional until proven not to be, while the opposite is true for noncoding genes.

We focus in particular on long noncoding {RNA} (noncoding {RNAs} longer than 200 nucleotides) genes and their 'junk' associates, transposable elements, and satellite repeats.

Avoiding such stable genomic aberrations is paramount for successful use of {hiPSCs}, but it is equally important to ensure that their epigenetic information is correct, given the critical role of epigenetics in transcriptional regulation and its involvement in a plethora of pathologic conditions. In this review we will focus on genomic imprinting, a prototypical epigenetic mechanism whereby a gene is expressed in a parent-of-origin specific manner, thanks to the differential methylation of specific {DNA} sequences. Conventional {hiPSCs} are thought to be in a pluripotent state primed for differentiation. They display a hypermethylated genome with an unexpected loss of {DNA} methylation at imprinted loci. Several groups recently reported the generation of {hiPSCs} in a more primitive developmental stage, called naïve pluripotency. Naïve {hiPSCs} share several features with early human embryos, such as a global genome hypomethylation, which is also accompanied by a widespread loss of {DNA} methylation at imprinted loci. Given that loss of imprinting has been observed in genetic developmental disorders as well as in a wide range of cancers, it is fundamental to make sure that {hiPSCs} do not show such epigenetic aberrations. We will discuss what specific imprinted genes, associated with human pathologies, have been found commonly misregulated in {hiPSCs} and suggest strategies to effectively detect and avoid such undesirable epigenetic abnormalities.}

Reactome functions both as an archive of biological processes and as a tool for discovering functional relationships in data such as gene expression profiles or somatic mutation catalogs from tumor cells. To extend our ability to annotate human disease processes, we have implemented a new drug class and have used it initially to annotate drugs relevant to cardiovascular disease. Our annotation model depends on external domain experts to identify new areas for annotation and to review new content. New web pages facilitate recruitment of community experts and allow those who have contributed to Reactome to identify their contributions and link them to their {ORCID} records. To improve visualization of our content, we have implemented a new tool to automatically lay out the components of individual reactions with multiple options for downloading the reaction diagrams and associated data, and a new display of our event hierarchy that will facilitate visual interpretation of pathway analysis results. \copyright The Author(s) 2019.

Today, we are far removed from the original reductive vision of {TEs} as "junk {DNA}", and are more convinced that {TEs} represent an essential element in the regulation of gene expression.

Profiling {DNA} methylomes from organisms across the eukaryotic tree of life has reshaped our views on the evolution of {5mC}. In this review, we explore the macroevolution of {5mC} in major eukaryotic groups, and then focus on recent advances made in animals. Genomic {5mC} patterns as well as the mechanisms of {5mC} deposition tend to be evolutionary labile across large phylogenetic distances; however, some common patterns are starting to emerge. Within the animal kingdom, {5mC} diversity has proven to be much greater than anticipated. For example, a previously held common view that genome hypermethylation is a trait exclusive to vertebrates has recently been challenged. Also, data from genome-wide studies are starting to yield insights into the potential roles of {5mC} in invertebrate cis regulation.

This amino acid has uniquely moderate basic properties and is an important group in many catalytic functions of enzymes. A compilation of currently known primary structures of {HisRS} shows that the subunits of these homo-dimeric enzymes consist of 420-550 amino acid residues. This represents a relatively short chain length among aminoacyl-{tRNA} synthetases ({aaRS}), whose peptide chain sizes range from about 300 to 1100 amino acid residues. The crystal structures of {HisRS} from two organisms and their complexes with histidine, histidyl-adenylate and histidinol with {ATP} have been solved. {HisRS} from Escherichia coli and Thermus thermophilus are very similar dimeric enzymes consisting of three domains: the N-terminal catalytic domain containing the six-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet and the three motifs characteristic of class {II} {aaRS}, a {HisRS}-specific helical domain inserted between motifs 2 and 3 that may contact the acceptor stem of the {tRNA}, and a C-terminal alpha/beta domain that may be involved in the recognition of the anticodon stem and loop of {tRNA}(His). The aminoacylation reaction follows the standard two-step mechanism. {HisRS} also belongs to the group of {aaRS} that can rapidly synthesize diadenosine tetraphosphate, a compound that is suspected to be involved in several regulatory mechanisms of cell metabolism. Many analogs of histidine have been tested for their properties as substrates or inhibitors of {HisRS}, leading to the elucidation of structure-activity relationships concerning configuration, importance of the carboxy and amino group, and the nature of the side chain. {HisRS} has been found to act as a particularly important antigen in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatic arthritis or myositis. Successful attempts have been made to identify epitopes responsible for the complexation with such auto-antibodies.}

Here, we present {diffTF} (https://git.embl.de/grp-zaugg/{diffTF}) to calculate differential {TF} activity (basic mode) and classify {TFs} into putative transcriptional activators or repressors (classification mode). In basic mode, it combines genome-wide chromatin accessibility/activity with putative {TF} binding sites that, in classification mode, are integrated with {RNA}-seq. We apply {diffTF} to compare (1) mutated and unmutated chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients and (2) two hematopoietic progenitor cell types. In both datasets, {diffTF} recovers most known biology and finds many previously unreported {TFs}. It classifies almost 40\% of {TFs} based on their mode of action, which we validate experimentally. Overall, we demonstrate that {diffTF} recovers known biology, identifies less well-characterized {TFs}, and classifies {TFs} into transcriptional activators or repressors.

We detect anomalies for 30 {GEUVADIS} and 16 Human Body Map samples. By correcting anomalies when possible, we reduce the number of falsely predicted instances of differential expression.

A popular model posits that inheritance of modified histones, especially in the form of H3-H4 tetramers, underlies inheritance of heterochromatin. Because H3-H4 tetramers are randomly distributed between daughter chromatids during {DNA} replication, rare occurrences of asymmetric tetramer inheritance within a heterochromatic domain would have the potential to destabilize heterochromatin. This model makes a prediction that shorter heterochromatic domains would experience unbalanced tetramer inheritance more frequently, and thereby be less stable. In contrast to this prediction, we found that shortening a heterochromatic domain in Saccharomyces had no impact on the strength of silencing nor its heritability. Additionally, we found that replisome mutations that disrupt inheritance of H3-H4 tetramers had only minor effects on heterochromatin stability. These findings suggest that histones carry little or no memory of the heterochromatin state through {DNA} replication. \copyright 2019, Saxton and Rine.}

Because enhancers are critical for development, and the majority of disease-associated mutations reside within enhancers, it is essential to understand which sequences within enhancers are important for function. Advances in sequencing technology have enabled the rapid generation of genomic data that predict putative active enhancers, but functionally validating these sequences at scale remains a fundamental challenge. Herein, we discuss the power of genome-wide strategies used to identify candidate enhancers, and also highlight limitations and misconceptions that have arisen from these data. We discuss the use of massively parallel reporter assays to test enhancers for function at scale. We also review recent advances in our ability to study gene regulation during development, including {CRISPR}-based tools to manipulate genomes and single-cell transcriptomics to finely map gene expression. Finally, we look ahead to a synthesis of complementary genomic approaches that will advance our understanding of enhancer function during development.

In consideration of their evolutionary origins and inherent limitations in genome annotation practices, we posit that pseudogenes have been classified on a scientifically unsubstantiated basis. We reflect that a broad misunderstanding of pseudogenes, perpetuated in part by the pejorative inference of the 'pseudogene' label, has led to their frequent dismissal from functional assessment and exclusion from genomic analyses. With the advent of technologies that simplify the study of pseudogenes, we propose that an objective reassessment of these genomic elements will reveal valuable insights into genome function and evolution.}

While it is now clear that astrocytes are affected by {HD} and significantly contribute to neuronal dysfunction and pathogenesis, the alterations in the transcriptional and epigenetic profiles in {HD} astrocytes have yet to be characterized. Here, we examine global transcription and chromatin accessibility dynamics during in vitro astrocyte differentiation in a transgenic non-human primate model of {HD}. {RESULTS}: We found global changes in accessibility and transcription across different stages of {HD} pluripotent stem cell differentiation, with distinct trends first observed in neural progenitor cells ({NPCs}), once cells have committed to a neural lineage. Transcription of p53 signaling and cell cycle pathway genes was highly impacted during differentiation, with depletion in {HD} {NPCs} and upregulation in {HD} astrocytes. {E2F} target genes also displayed this inverse expression pattern, and strong associations between {E2F} target gene expression and accessibility at nearby putative enhancers were observed. {CONCLUSIONS}: The results suggest that chromatin accessibility and transcription are altered throughout in vitro {HD} astrocyte differentiation and provide evidence that {E2F} dysregulation contributes to aberrant cell-cycle re-entry and apoptosis throughout the progression from {NPCs} to astrocytes.}

In this study, we systematically benchmark deep learning ({DL}) and random forest ({RF})-based metadata augmentation of tissue, age, and sex using small {RNA} ({sRNA}) expression profiles. We use 4243 annotated {sRNA}-Seq samples from the {sRNA} expression atlas database to train and test the augmentation performance. In general, the {DL} machine learner outperforms the {RF} method in almost all tested cases. The average cross-validated prediction accuracy of the {DL} algorithm for tissues is 96.5\%, for sex is 77\%, and for age is 77.2\%. The average tissue prediction accuracy for a completely new data set is 83.1\% ({DL}) and 80.8\% ({RF}). To understand which {sRNAs} influence {DL} predictions, we employ backpropagation-based feature importance scores using the {DeepLIFT} method, which enable us to obtain information on biological relevance of {sRNAs}.}

abstract = {Characterization of Human Endogenous Retrovirus ({HERV}) expression within the transcriptomic landscape using {RNA}-seq is complicated by uncertainty in fragment assignment because of sequence similarity. We present Telescope, a computational software tool that provides accurate estimation of transposable element expression (retrotranscriptome) resolved to specific genomic locations. Telescope directly addresses uncertainty in fragment assignment by reassigning ambiguously mapped fragments to the most probable source transcript as determined within a Bayesian statistical model. We demonstrate the utility of our approach through single locus analysis of {HERV} expression in 13 {ENCODE} cell types. When examined at this resolution, we find that the magnitude and breadth of the retrotranscriptome can be vastly different among cell types. Furthermore, our approach is robust to differences in sequencing technology and demonstrates that the retrotranscriptome has potential to be used for cell type identification. We compared our tool with other approaches for quantifying transposable element ({TE}) expression, and found that Telescope has the greatest resolution, as it estimates expression at specific {TE} insertions rather than at the {TE} subfamily level. Telescope performs highly accurate quantification of the retrotranscriptomic landscape in {RNA}-seq experiments, revealing a differential complexity in the transposable element biology of complex systems not previously observed.

abstract = {In many organisms, early embryonic development is driven by maternally provided factors until the controlled onset of transcription during zygotic genome activation. The regulation of chromatin accessibility and its relationship to gene activity during this transition remain poorly understood. Here, we generated chromatin accessibility maps with {ATAC}-seq from genome activation until the onset of lineage specification. During this period, chromatin accessibility increases at regulatory elements. This increase is independent of {RNA} polymerase {II}-mediated transcription, with the exception of the hypertranscribed {miR}-430 locus. Instead, accessibility often precedes the transcription of associated genes. Loss of the maternal transcription factors Pou5f3, Sox19b, and Nanog, which are known to be required for zebrafish genome activation, results in decreased accessibility at regulatory elements. Importantly, the accessibility of regulatory regions, especially when established by Pou5f3, Sox19b and Nanog, is predictive for future transcription. Our results show that the maternally provided transcription factors Pou5f3, Sox19b, and Nanog open up chromatin and prime genes for activity during zygotic genome activation in zebrafish.}

In the yeast Cryptococcus neoformans, {CG} methylation occurs in transposon-rich repeats and requires the {DNA} methyltransferase Dnmt5. We show that Dnmt5 displays exquisite maintenance-type specificity in vitro and in vivo and utilizes similar in vivo cofactors as the metazoan maintenance methylase Dnmt1. Remarkably, phylogenetic and functional analysis revealed that the ancestral species lost the gene for a de novo methylase, {DnmtX}, between 50-150 mya. We examined how methylation has persisted since the ancient loss of {DnmtX}. Experimental and comparative studies reveal efficient replication of methylation patterns in C. neoformans, rare stochastic methylation loss and gain events, and the action of natural selection.

To characterize this understudied process, we profiled and analyzed single-cell transcriptomes of ∼10,000 testicular cells from four boys spanning puberty and compared them to those of infants and adults. During puberty, undifferentiated spermatogonia sequentially expand and differentiate prior to the initiation of gametogenesis. Notably, we identify a common pre-pubertal progenitor for Leydig and myoid cells and delineate candidate factors controlling pubertal differentiation. Furthermore, pre-pubertal Sertoli cells exhibit two distinct transcriptional states differing in metabolic profiles before converging to an alternative single mature population during puberty. Roles for testosterone in Sertoli cell maturation, antimicrobial peptide secretion, and spermatogonial differentiation are further highlighted through single-cell analysis of testosterone-suppressed transfemale testes. Taken together, our transcriptional atlas of the developing human testis provides multiple insights into developmental changes and key factors accompanying male puberty.

abstract = {From an abstract, informational perspective, protein domains appear analogous to words in natural languages in which the rules of word association are dictated by linguistic rules, or grammar. Such rules exist for protein domains as well, because only a small fraction of all possible domain combinations is viable in evolution. We employ a popular linguistic technique, n-gram analysis, to probe the "proteome grammar"-that is, the rules of association of domains that generate various domain architectures of proteins. Comparison of the complexity measures of "protein languages" in major branches of life shows that the relative entropy difference (information gain) between the observed domain architectures and random domain combinations is highly conserved in evolution and is close to being a universal constant, at ∼1.2 bits. Substantial deviations from this constant are observed in only two major groups of organisms: a subset of Archaea that appears to be cells simplified to the limit, and animals that display extreme complexity. We also identify the n-grams that represent signatures of the major branches of cellular life. The results of this analysis bolster the analogy between genomes and natural language and show that a "quasi-universal grammar" underlies the evolution of domain architectures in all divisions of cellular life. The nearly universal value of information gain by the domain architectures could reflect the minimum complexity of signal processing that is required to maintain a functioning cell.

abstract = {Background: Transposable elements ({TEs}) are an important source of genomic variability in eukaryotic genomes. Their activity impacts genome architecture and gene expression and can lead to drastic phenotypic changes. Therefore, identifying {TE} polymorphisms is key to better understand the link between genotype and phenotype. However, most genotype-to-phenotype analyses have concentrated on single nucleotide polymorphisms as they are easier to reliable detect using short-read data. Many bioinformatic tools have been developed to identify transposon insertions from resequencing data using short reads. Nevertheless, the performance of most of these tools has been tested using simulated insertions, which do not accurately reproduce the complexity of natural insertions. Results: We have overcome this limitation by building a dataset of insertions from the comparison of two high-quality rice genomes, followed by extensive manual curation. This dataset contains validated insertions of two very different types of {TEs}, {LTR}-retrotransposons and {MITEs}. Using this dataset, we have benchmarked the sensitivity and precision of 12 commonly used tools, and our results suggest that in general their sensitivity was previously overestimated when using simulated data. Our results also show that, increasing coverage leads to a better sensitivity but with a cost in precision. Moreover, we found important differences in tool performance, with some tools performing better on a specific type of {TEs}. We have also used two sets of experimentally validated insertions in Drosophila and humans and show that this trend is maintained in genomes of different size and complexity. Conclusions: We discuss the possible choice of tools depending on the goals of the study and show that the appropriate combination of tools could be an option for most approaches, increasing the sensitivity while maintaining a good precision. \copyright The Author(s). 2019.}

This review introduces the intrinsic functions of transposons, the tactics employed in their restraint, and the relevance of this conflict to human pathology. The most straightforward examples of disease-causing transposable elements are germline insertions that disrupt a gene and result in a monogenic disease allele. More enigmatic are the abnormal patterns of transposable element expression in disease states. Changes in transposon regulation and cellular responses to their expression have implicated these sequences in diseases as diverse as cancer, autoimmunity, and neurodegeneration. Distinguishing their epiphenomenal from their pathogenic effects may provide wholly new perspectives on our understanding of disease.}

To define their temporal relationship, we developed {ATAC}-Me, which probes accessibility and methylation from single {DNA} library preparations. We identified waves of accessibility occurring rapidly across thousands of myeloid enhancers in a monocyte-to-macrophage cell fate model. Prolonged methylation states were observed at a majority of these sites, while transcription of nearby genes tracked closely with accessibility. {ATAC}-Me uncovers a significant disconnect between chromatin accessibility, {DNA} methylation status, and gene activity.

abstract = {Spatiotemporally-restricted {RNA} expression is a crucial, conserved mechanism for maintaining tissue viability, morphology, and integrity. In particular, localization of {RNA} molecules to subcellular compartments is a prevalent mechanism for regulating the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation during development. Perturbations in the regulation of this balance are often associated with developmental defects and diseases such as cancer. However, our understanding of how spatiotemporal distribution of {RNAs} shapes cell proliferation and differentiation is still limited. In this study, we used the Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodite germline as an in vivo model for proliferation and differentiation. We adapted and optimized a cryo-cut-sequencing technique to determine, at near single cell resolution, {RNA} expression as a function of position along the germline. With this technique, we detected and quantified over 10,000 {mRNAs} and over 300 {miRNAs} but also numerous putative novel {miRNAs} and novel 3\textquoteright {UTR} isoforms. Most of these {RNAs} displayed highly organized localization patterns. Interestingly, not only {mRNAs} and {miRNAs} but also endogenous {siRNAs} and {piRNAs} exhibited distinct localization patterns. In addition, we showed that the spatiotemporal gene expression was strongly perturbed in the tumorous and solely proliferating gld-2 gld-1 double mutant germline indicating the importance of {mRNA} localization in maintaining the balance between proliferation and differentiation. Moreover, by comparing the gene expression of wild type and mutant, we identified {PIE}-1, a transcriptional repressor, as a potential key player in maintaining and regulating the spatiotemporal gene expression. Furthermore, we showed that differential 3\textquoteright {UTR} usage, a key mechanism in regulating gene expression in space and time, is a common phenomenon along the germline. Surprisingly, the spatiotemporal regulation of the 3\textquoteright {UTR} choice was significantly disrupted in the gld-2 gld-1 mutant. Our data suggests that cpsf-4 and fipp-1 are involved in the regulation of differential 3\textquoteright {UTR} usage for almost 1,000 genes in the germline. Finally, we constructed a physical {3D} germline model that integrates our data providing a user-friendly interface for exploring spatiotemporally-restricted {RNA} expression during germ cell proliferation and differentiation (https://shiny.mdc-berlin.de/spacegerm/).}

abstract = {Exposure of cells or organisms to chemicals can trigger a series of effects at the regulatory pathway level, which involve changes of levels, interactions, and feedback loops of biomolecules of different types. A single-omics technique, e.g., transcriptomics, will detect biomolecules of one type and thus can only capture changes in a small subset of the biological cascade. Therefore, although applying single-omics analyses can lead to the identification of biomarkers for certain exposures, they cannot provide a systemic understanding of toxicity pathways or adverse outcome pathways. Integration of multiple omics data sets promises a substantial improvement in detecting this pathway response to a toxicant, by an increase of information as such and especially by a systemic understanding. Here, we report the findings of a thorough evaluation of the prospects and challenges of multi-omics data integration in toxicological research. We review the availability of such data, discuss options for experimental design, evaluate methods for integration and analysis of multi-omics data, discuss best practices, and identify knowledge gaps. Re-analyzing published data, we demonstrate that multi-omics data integration can considerably improve the confidence in detecting a pathway response. Finally, we argue that more data need to be generated from studies with a multi-omics-focused design, to define which omics layers contribute most to the identification of a pathway response to a toxicant.}

abstract = {For most biological processes, organisms must respond to extrinsic cues, while maintaining essential gene expression programs. Although studied extensively in single cells, it is still unclear how variation is controlled in multicellular organisms. Here, we used a machine-learning approach to identify genomic features that are predictive of genes with high versus low variation in their expression across individuals, using bulk data to remove stochastic cell-to-cell variation. Using embryonic gene expression across 75 Drosophila isogenic lines, we identify features predictive of expression variation, while controlling for expression level. Genes with low variation fall into two classes, indicating they employ different mechanisms to maintain a robust expression. In contrast, genes with high variation seem to lack both types of stabilizing mechanisms. Applying the framework to human tissues from {GTEx} revealed similar predictive features, indicating that promoter architecture is an ancient mechanism to control expression variation. Remarkably, expression variation features could also predict differential expression upon stress in both Drosophila and human. Differential gene expression signatures may therefore be partially explained by genetically encoded gene-specific features, unrelated to the studied treatment.}

Genome-wide {LINE}-1 mapping in single cells could be useful for defining somatic and germline retrotransposition rates, and for enabling studies to characterize tumour heterogeneity, relate insertions to transcriptional and epigenetic effects at the cellular level, or describe cellular phylogenies in development. Our laboratories have reported a genome-wide {LINE}-1 insertion site mapping method for bulk {DNA}, named transposon insertion profiling by sequencing ({TIPseq}). There have been significant barriers applying {LINE}-1 mapping to single cells, owing to the chimeric artefacts and features of repetitive sequences. Here, we optimize a modified {TIPseq} protocol and show its utility for {LINE}-1 mapping in single lymphoblastoid cells. Results from single-cell {TIPseq} experiments compare well to known {LINE}-1 insertions found by whole-genome sequencing and {TIPseq} on bulk {DNA}. Among the several approaches we tested, whole-genome amplification by multiple displacement amplification followed by restriction enzyme digestion, vectorette ligation and {LINE}-1-targeted {PCR} had the best assay performance.

A large proportion of this non-coding part of mammalian genomes is repetitive in nature, classified as either satellites or transposons. While repetitive elements can be termed selfish in terms of their amplification, such events have surely been co-opted by the host, suggesting by itself a likely altruistic function for the organism at the subject of such natural selection. Indeed numerous examples of transposons regulating the functional output of the host genome have been documented. Transposons provide a powerful framework for large-scale relatively rapid concerted regulatory activities with the ability to drive evolution. Mammalian totipotency has emerged as one key stage of development in which transposon-mediated regulation of gene expression has taken centre stage in the past few years. During this period, large-scale (epigenetic) reprogramming must be accomplished in order to activate the host genome. In mice and men, one particular element murine endogenous retrovirus with leucine {tRNA} primer ({MERVL}) (and its counterpart human {ERVL} ({HERVL})) appears to have acquired roles as a key driving force in this process. Here, I will discuss and interpret the current knowledge and its implications regarding the role of transposons, particularly of long interspersed nuclear elements ({LINE}-1s) and endogenous retroviruses ({ERVs}), in the regulation of totipotency.

Although not all present-day {TE} copies have retained this regulatory function, the preexisting regulatory potential of {TEs} can provide a rich source of cis-regulatory innovation for the host. Here, we review recent evidence documenting diverse contributions of {TE} sequences to gene regulation by functioning as enhancers, promoters, silencers and boundary elements. We discuss how {TE}-derived enhancer sequences can rapidly facilitate changes in existing gene regulatory networks and mediate species- and cell-type-specific regulatory innovations, and we postulate a unique contribution of {TEs} to species-specific gene expression divergence in pluripotency and early embryogenesis. With advances in genome-wide technologies and analyses, systematic investigation of {TEs}' cis-regulatory potential is now possible and our understanding of the biological impact of genomic {TEs} is increasing.

abstract = {Diversity of omic technologies has expanded in the last years together with the number of omic data integration strategies. However, multiomic data generation is costly, and many research groups cannot afford research projects where many different omic techniques are generated, at least at the same time. As most researchers share their data in public repositories, different omic datasets of the same biological system obtained at different labs can be combined to construct a multiomic study. However, data obtained at different labs or moments in time are typically subjected to batch effects that need to be removed for successful data integration. While there are methods to correct batch effects on the same data types obtained in different studies, they cannot be applied to correct lab or batch effects across omics. This impairs multiomic meta-analysis. Fortunately, in many cases, at least one omics platform-i.e. gene expression- is repeatedly measured across labs, together with the additional omic modalities that are specific to each study. This creates an opportunity for batch analysis. We have developed {MultiBaC} (multiomic Multiomics Batch-effect Correction correction), a strategy to correct batch effects from multiomic datasets distributed across different labs or data acquisition events. Our strategy is based on the existence of at least one shared data type which allows data prediction across omics. We validate this approach both on simulated data and on a case where the multiomic design is fully shared by two labs, hence batch effect correction within the same omic modality using traditional methods can be compared with the {MultiBaC} correction across data types. Finally, we apply {MultiBaC} to a true multiomic data integration problem to show that we are able to improve the detection of meaningful biological effects.}

Actually, real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction is the most widely used approach for circulating {miRNAs} (c-{miRNAs}) expression profiling. Nevertheless, the debate on the choice of the most suitable endogenous reference genes for c-{miRNAs} expression levels normalization is still open.

abstract = {Repetitive elements are abundantly distributed in mammalian genomes. Here, we reveal a striking association between repeat subtypes and gene function. {SINE}, L1, and low-complexity repeats demarcate distinct functional categories of genes and may dictate the time and level of gene expression by providing binding sites for different regulatory proteins. Importantly, imaging and sequencing analysis show that L1 repeats sequester a large set of genes with specialized functions in nucleolus- and lamina-associated inactive domains that are depleted of {SINE} repeats. In addition, L1 transcripts bind extensively to its {DNA} in embryonic stem cells ({ESCs}). Depletion of L1 {RNA} in {ESCs} leads to relocation of L1-enriched chromosomal segments from inactive domains to the nuclear interior and de-repression of L1-associated genes. These results demonstrate a role of L1 {DNA} and {RNA} in gene silencing and suggest a general theme of genomic repeats in orchestrating the function, regulation, and expression of their host genes.

abstract = {The paternal genome undergoes a massive exchange of histone with protamine for compaction into sperm during spermiogenesis. Upon fertilization, this process is potently reversed, which is essential for parental genome reprogramming and subsequent activation; however, it remains poorly understood how this fundamental process is initiated and regulated. Here, we report that the previously characterized splicing kinase {SRPK1} initiates this life-beginning event by catalyzing site-specific phosphorylation of protamine, thereby triggering protamine-to-histone exchange in the fertilized oocyte. Interestingly, protamine undergoes a {DNA}-dependent phase transition to gel-like condensates and {SRPK1}-mediated phosphorylation likely helps open up such structures to enhance protamine dismissal by nucleoplasmin ({NPM2}) and enable the recruitment of {HIRA} for H3.3 deposition. Remarkably, genome-wide assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing ({ATAC}-seq) analysis reveals that selective chromatin accessibility in both sperm and {MII} oocytes is largely erased in early pronuclei in a protamine phosphorylation-dependent manner, suggesting that {SRPK1}-catalyzed phosphorylation initiates a highly synchronized reorganization program in both parental genomes.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The mammalian epididymis is responsible for the provision of a highly specialized environment in which spermatozoa acquire functional maturity and are subsequently stored in preparation for ejaculation. Making important contributions to both processes are epididymosomes, small extracellular vesicles released from the epididymal soma via an apocrine secretory pathway. While considerable effort has been focused on defining the cargo transferred between epididymosomes and spermatozoa, comparatively less is known about the mechanistic basis of these interactions. To investigate this phenomenon, we have utilized an in vitro co-culture system to track the transfer of biotinylated protein cargo between mouse epididymosomes and recipient spermatozoa isolated from the caput epididymis; an epididymal segment that is of critical importance for promoting sperm maturation. {RESULTS}: Our data indicate that epididymosome-sperm interactions are initiated via tethering of the epididymosome to receptors restricted to the post-acrosomal domain of the sperm head. Thereafter, epididymosomes mediate the transfer of protein cargo to spermatozoa via a process that is dependent on dynamin, a family of mechanoenzymes that direct intercellular vesicle trafficking. Notably, upon co-culture of sperm with epididymosomes, dynamin 1 undergoes a pronounced relocation between the peri- and post-acrosomal domains of the sperm head. This repositioning of dynamin 1 is potentially mediated via its association with membrane rafts and ideally locates the enzyme to facilitate the uptake of epididymosome-borne proteins. Accordingly, disruption of membrane raft integrity or pharmacological inhibition of dynamin both potently suppress the transfer of biotinylated epididymosome proteins to spermatozoa. {CONCLUSION}: Together, these data provide new mechanistic insight into epididymosome-sperm interactions with potential implications extending to the manipulation of sperm maturation for the purpose of fertility regulation.}

Whether this occurs stochastically or represents a relatively conserved layer of epigenetic information is unclear. Here we show that several predominantly hominoid-specific families of transposable elements ({TEs}) consistently resist {DNA} demethylation (henceforth called {hPGC}-methylated {TEs} or escapees) during the epigenetic resetting of {hPGCs}. Some of them undergo subsequent dynamic epigenetic changes during embryonic development. Our analysis of the fetal cerebral cortex also revealed multiple classes of young {hPGC}-methylated {TEs} within putative and established enhancers. Remarkably, specific {hPGC}-methylated {TE} subfamilies were associated with a multitude of adaptive human traits, including hair colour and intelligence, and diseases including schizophrenia and Alzheimers disease. We postulate that {hPGC}-methylated {TEs} represent potentially heritable information within the germline with a role in human development and evolution.}

Computational error correction promises to eliminate sequencing errors, but the relative accuracy of error correction algorithms remains unknown. {RESULTS}: In this paper, we evaluate the ability of error correction algorithms to fix errors across different types of datasets that contain various levels of heterogeneity. We highlight the advantages and limitations of computational error correction techniques across different domains of biology, including immunogenomics and virology. To demonstrate the efficacy of our technique, we apply the {UMI}-based high-fidelity sequencing protocol to eliminate sequencing errors from both simulated data and the raw reads. We then perform a realistic evaluation of error-correction methods. {CONCLUSIONS}: In terms of accuracy, we find that method performance varies substantially across different types of datasets with no single method performing best on all types of examined data.

Spermatogenesis occurs in the testes, behind a protective barrier to ensure safeguarding of germline {DNA} from environmental insults. Following {DNA} compaction, further sperm maturation occurs in the epididymis. Here, we report reproductive tract {EVs} transmit information regarding stress in the paternal environment to sperm, potentially altering fetal development. Using intracytoplasmic sperm injection, we found that sperm incubated with {EVs} collected from stress-treated epididymal epithelial cells produced offspring with altered neurodevelopment and adult stress reactivity. Proteomic and transcriptomic assessment of these {EVs} showed dramatic changes in protein and {miRNA} content long after stress treatment had ended, supporting a lasting programmatic change in response to chronic stress. Thus, {EVs} as a normal process in sperm maturation, can also perform roles in intergenerational transmission of paternal environmental experience.}

Nevertheless, support for paternal germline epigenetic inheritance ({GEI}) in nonhuman mammals continues to grow and the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are becoming clearer. To what extent do similar processes operate in humans, and if so, what are their implications for understanding human phenotypic variation, health, and evolution? Here, we review evidence for {GEI} in human and nonhuman mammals and evaluate these findings in relation to historical conceptions of heredity.

We identified a robust response to {SAM} depletion that is highlighted by preferential cytoplasmic and nuclear mono-methylation of H3 Lys 9 ({H3K9}) at the expense of broad losses in histone di- and tri-methylation. Under {SAM}-depleted conditions, {H3K9} mono-methylation preserves heterochromatin stability and supports global epigenetic persistence upon metabolic recovery. This unique chromatin response was robust across the mouse lifespan and correlated with improved metabolic health, supporting a significant role for epigenetic adaptation to {SAM} depletion in vivo.

Recent epigenomic studies have revealed the unusual chromatin landscapes that are present in oocytes, sperm and early preimplantation embryos, including atypical patterns of histone modifications2-4 and differences in chromosome organization and accessibility, both in gametes5-8 and after fertilization5,8-10. However, these studies have led to very different conclusions: the global absence of local topological-associated domains ({TADs}) in gametes and their appearance in the embryo8,9 versus the pre-existence of {TADs} and loops in the zygote5,11. The questions of whether parental structures can be inherited in the newly formed embryo and how these structures might relate to allele-specific gene regulation remain open. Here we map genomic interactions for each parental genome (including the X chromosome), using an optimized single-cell high-throughput chromosome conformation capture ({HiC}) protocol12,13, during preimplantation in the mouse. We integrate chromosome organization with allelic expression states and chromatin marks, and reveal that higher-order chromatin structure after fertilization coincides with an allele-specific enrichment of methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27. These early parental-specific domains correlate with gene repression and participate in parentally biased gene expression-including in recently described, transiently imprinted loci14. We also find {TADs} that arise in a non-parental-specific manner during a second wave of genome assembly. These de novo domains are associated with active chromatin. Finally, we obtain insights into the relationship between {TADs} and gene expression by investigating structural changes to the paternal X chromosome before and during X chromosome inactivation in preimplantation female embryos15. We find that {TADs} are lost as genes become silenced on the paternal X chromosome but linger in regions that escape X chromosome inactivation. These findings demonstrate the complex dynamics of three-dimensional genome organization and gene expression during early development.}

Micro-C robustly captures known features of chromosome folding including compartment organization, topologically associating domains, and interactions between {CTCF} binding sites. In addition, Micro-C provides a detailed map of nucleosome positions and localizes contact domain boundaries with nucleosomal precision. Compared to Hi-C, Micro-C exhibits an order of magnitude greater dynamic range, allowing the identification of ∼20,000 additional loops in each cell type. Many newly identified peaks are localized along extrusion stripes and form transitive grids, consistent with their anchors being pause sites impeding cohesin-dependent loop extrusion.

abstract = {The ability of living systems to adapt to changing conditions originates from their capacity to change their molecular constitution. This is achieved by multiple mechanisms that modulate the quantitative composition and the diversity of the molecular inventory. Molecular diversification is particularly pronounced on the proteome level, at which multiple proteoforms derived from the same gene can in turn combinatorially form different protein complexes, thus expanding the repertoire of functional modules in the cell. The study of molecular and modular diversity and their involvement in responses to changing conditions has only recently become possible through the development of new 'omics'-based screening technologies. This Review explores our current knowledge of the mechanisms regulating functional diversification along the axis of gene expression, with a focus on the proteome and interactome. We explore the interdependence between different molecular levels and how this contributes to functional diversity. Finally, we highlight several recent techniques for studying molecular diversity, with specific focus on mass spectrometry-based analysis of the proteome and its organization into functional modules, and examine future directions for this rapidly growing field.}

abstract = {Transposable elements ({TEs}) compose nearly half of mammalian genomes and provide building blocks for cis-regulatory elements. Using high-throughput sequencing, we show that 84 {TE} subfamilies are overrepresented, and distributed in a lineage-specific fashion in core and boundary domains of {CD8}+ T cell enhancers. Endogenous retroviruses are most significantly enriched in core domains with accessible chromatin, and bear recognition motifs for immune-related transcription factors. In contrast, short interspersed elements ({SINEs}) are preferentially overrepresented in nucleosome-containing boundaries. A substantial proportion of these {SINEs} harbor a high density of the enhancer-specific histone mark {H3K4me1} and carry sequences that match enhancer boundary nucleotide composition. Motifs with regulatory features are better preserved within enhancer-enriched {TE} copies compared to their subfamily equivalents located in gene deserts. {TE}-rich and {TE}-poor enhancers associate with both shared and unique gene groups and are enriched in overlapping functions related to lymphocyte and leukocyte biology. The majority of T cell enhancers are shared with other immune lineages and are accessible in common hematopoietic progenitors. A higher proportion of immune tissue-specific enhancers are {TE}-rich compared to enhancers specific to other tissues, correlating with higher {TE} occurrence in immune gene-associated genomic regions. Our results suggest that during evolution, {TEs} abundant in these regions and carrying motifs potentially beneficial for enhancer architecture and immune functions were particularly frequently incorporated by evolving enhancers. Their putative selection and regulatory cooption may have accelerated the evolution of immune regulatory networks. Copyright \copyright 2020 the Author(s). Published by {PNAS}.}

We investigated the dynamics of lysine acetylation and crotonylation on histones H3 and H4 during mouse spermatogenesis. Lysine crotonylation appeared to be of significant abundance compared to acetylation, particularly on Lys27 of histone H3 ({H3K27cr}) that accumulates in sperm in a cleaved form of H3. We identified the genomic localization of {H3K27cr} and studied its effects on transcription compared to the classical active mark {H3K27ac} at promoters and distal enhancers. The presence of both marks was strongly associated with highest gene expression. Assessment of their co-localization with transcription regulators ({SLY}, {SOX30}) and chromatin-binding proteins ({BRD4}, {BRDT}, {BORIS} and {CTCF}) indicated systematic highest binding when both active marks were present and different selective binding when present alone at chromatin. {H3K27cr} and {H3K27ac} finally mark the building of some sperm super-enhancers. This integrated analysis of omics data provides an unprecedented level of understanding of gene expression regulation by {H3K27cr} in comparison to {H3K27ac}, and reveals both synergistic and specific actions of each histone modification. \copyright The Author(s) 2020.

It combines the benefits of various open-source software tools including R Markdown, Git, Make, and Docker, whose interplay ensures seamless integration of version management, dynamic report generation conforming to various journal styles and full cross-platform and long-term computational reproducibility. The workflow ensures meeting the primary goals that 1) the reporting of statistical results is consistent with the actual statistical results (dynamic report generation), the analysis exactly reproduces at a later time even if the computing platform or software is changed (computational reproducibility), and 3) changes at any time (during development and post-publication) are tracked, tagged, and documented while earlier versions of both data and code remain accessible. While the research community increasingly recognizes dynamic document generation and version management as tools to ensure reproducibility, we demonstrate with practical examples that these alone are not sufficient to ensure long-term computational reproducibility. Leveraging containerization, dependence management, version management, and literate programming, the workflow increases scientific productivity by facilitating later reproducibility and reuse of code and data.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The increasing number of transcriptomic datasets has allowed for meta-analyses, which can be valuable due to their increased statistical power. However, meta-analyses can be confounded by so-called "batch effects," where technical variation across different batches of {RNA}-seq experiments can clearly produce spurious signals of differential expression and reduce our power to detect true differences. While batch effects can sometimes be accounted for, albeit with caveats, a better strategy is to understand their sources to better avoid them. In this study, we examined the effects of {RNA} isolation method as a possible source of batch effects in {RNA}-seq design. {RESULTS}: Based on the different chemistries of "classic" hot phenol extraction of {RNA} compared to common commercial {RNA} isolation kits, we hypothesized that specific {mRNAs} may be preferentially extracted depending upon method, which could masquerade as differential expression in downstream {RNA}-seq analyses. We tested this hypothesis using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae heat shock response as a well-validated environmental response. Comparing technical replicates that only differed in {RNA} isolation method, we found over one thousand transcripts that appeared "differentially" expressed when comparing hot phenol extraction with the two kits. Strikingly, transcripts with higher abundance in the phenol-extracted samples were enriched for membrane proteins, suggesting that indeed the chemistry of hot phenol extraction better solubilizes those species of {mRNA}. {CONCLUSIONS}: Within a self-contained experimental batch (e.g. control versus treatment), the method of {RNA} isolation had little effect on the ability to identify differentially expressed transcripts. However, we suggest that researchers performing meta-analyses across different experimental batches strongly consider the {RNA} isolation methods for each experiment.}

The {BTB} divides the seminiferous tubules into the adluminal and basal compartments. Spermatogonial stem cells ({\SSCs}) have a unique ability to transmigrate from the adluminal compartment to the basal compartment through the {BTB} upon transplantation into the seminiferous tubule. Here, we analyzed the role of Cldn11, a major component of the {BTB}, in spermatogenesis using spermatogonial transplantation. Cldn11-deficient mice are infertile due to the cessation of spermatogenesis at the spermatocyte stage. Cldn11-deficient {\SSCs} failed to colonize wild-type testes efficiently, and Cldn11-deficient {\SSCs} that underwent double depletion of Cldn3 and Cldn5 showed minimal colonization, suggesting that claudins on {\SSCs} are necessary for transmigration. However, Cldn11-deficient Sertoli cells increased {\SSC} homing efficiency by \textgreater3-fold, suggesting that {CLDN11} in Sertoli cells inhibits transmigration of {\SSCs} through the {BTB}. In contrast to endogenous {\SSCs} in intact Cldn11-deficient testes, those from {WT} or Cldn11-deficient testes regenerated sperm in Cldn11-deficient testes. The success of this autologous transplantation appears to depend on removal of endogenous germ cells for recipient preparation, which reprogrammed claudin expression patterns in Sertoli cells. Consistent with this idea, in vivo depletion of Cldn3/5 regenerated endogenous spermatogenesis in Cldn11-deficient mice. Thus, coordinated claudin expression in both {\SSCs} and Sertoli cells expression is necessary for {\SSC} homing and regeneration of spermatogenesis, and autologous stem cell transplantation can rescue congenital defects of a self-renewing tissue.}

In particular, whether histone modifications serve a regulatory role, for example by marking functional elements for later activation, remains debated. Here we trained a support vector regression to infer the genomic distribution of 11 widely studied histone modifications using nascent transcription as input. Transcription captured the variation in active histone modifications, including punctate promoter and enhancer marks (e.g., {H3K4me3}, {H3K4me1}, and {H3K27ac}) and elongation marks (e.g., {H3K36me3}), down to single-nucleosome resolution at an accuracy that rivaled the correspondence between independent {ChIP}-seq experiments. The relationship between active histone modifications and transcription was conserved in all cell types examined. Surprisingly, transcription also accurately predicted the repressive chromatin mark {H3K27me3}. However, unlike active marks, {H3K27me3} was found in two distinct patterns in different cell types: one pattern in fully differentiated cells covered broad regions with low levels of transcription, and a second pattern in stem cells was associated with transcription start sites of weakly transcribed genes. Transcription accurately identified bivalent promoters in embryonic stem cells, as well as other complex chromatin states identified by {chromHMM}. Although transcription accurately predicted nearly all histone modifications, we found a subset of {DNase}-I hypersensitive sites that were refractory to prediction, precluding models in which transcription initiates pervasively as a consequence of open chromatin. Our results demonstrate that histone modifications are tightly correlated with transcription, and provides a new tool for genome annotation using a single experiment.}

Confounding factors are regularly discussed in methodological literature, but their actual, practical impact on the outcome and interpretation of transcriptomics experiments is, to our knowledge, not documented. For instance, in-vivo experimental factors; like Individual, Sample-Composition and Time-of-Day are potentially formidable confounding factors. To study these confounding factors, we designed an extensive in-vivo transcriptome experiment (n = 264) with {UVR} exposure of murine skin containing six consecutive samples from each individual mouse (n = 64). {ANALYSIS} {APPROACH}: Evaluation of the confounding factors: Sample-Composition, Time-of-Day, Handling-Stress, and Individual-Mouse resulted in the identification of many genes that were affected by them. These genes sometimes showed over 30-fold expression differences. The most prominent confounding factor was Sample-Composition caused by mouse-dependent skin composition differences, sampling variation and/or influx/efflux of mobile cells. Although we can only evaluate these effects for known cell type specifically expressed genes in our complex heterogeneous samples, it is clear that the observed variations also affect the cumulative expression levels of many other non-cell-type-specific genes. {ANOVA}: {ANOVA} analysis can only attempt to neutralize the effects of the well-defined confounding factors, such as Individual-Mouse, on the experimental factors {UV}-Dose and Recovery-Time. Also, by definition, {ANOVA} only yields reproducible gene-expression differences, but we found that these differences were very small compared to the fold changes induced by the confounding factors, questioning the biological relevance of these {ANOVA}-detected differences. Furthermore, it turned out that many of the differentially expressed genes found by {ANOVA} were also present in the gene clusters associated with the confounding factors. {CONCLUSION}: Hence our overall conclusion is that confounding factors have a major impact on the outcome of in-vivo transcriptomics experiments. Thus the set-up, analysis, and interpretation of such experiments should be approached with the utmost prudence.}

abstract = {Background: Sequencing technologies give access to a precise picture of the molecular mechanisms acting upon genome regulation. One of the biggest technical challenges with sequencing data is to map millions of reads to a reference genome. This problem is exacerbated when dealing with repetitive sequences such as transposable elements that occupy half of the mammalian genome mass. Sequenced reads coming from these regions introduce ambiguities in the mapping step. Therefore, applying dedicated parameters and algorithms has to be taken into consideration when transposable elements regulation is investigated with sequencing datasets. Results: Here, we used simulated reads on the mouse and human genomes to define the best parameters for aligning transposable element-derived reads on a reference genome. The efficiency of the most commonly used aligners was compared and we further evaluated how transposable element representation should be estimated using available methods. The mappability of the different transposon families in the mouse and the human genomes was calculated giving an overview into their evolution. Conclusions: Based on simulated data, we provided recommendations on the alignment and the quantification steps to be performed when transposon expression or regulation is studied, and identified the limits in detecting specific young transposon families of the mouse and human genomes. These principles may help the community to adopt standard procedures and raise awareness of the difficulties encountered in the study of transposable elements. \copyright The Author(s). 2019.}

It remains unclear, however, which mechanisms of {miRNA} production or modification are organ-specific and the extent of their evolutionary conservation. To address these issues, we developed the software Prost! ({PRocessing} Of Short Transcripts), which, among other features, helps quantify mature {miRNAs}, accounts for post-transcriptional processing, such as nucleotide editing, and identifies mirror-{miRNAs}. Here, we applied Prost! to annotate and analyze {miRNAs} in three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), a model fish for evolutionary biology reported to have a {miRNome} larger than most teleost fish. Zebrafish (Danio rerio), a distantly related teleost with a well-known {miRNome}, served as comparator. Our results provided evidence for the existence of 286 {miRNA} genes and 382 unique mature {miRNAs} (excluding mir430 gene duplicates and the {vaultRNA}-derived mir733), which doesn't represent a {miRNAome} larger than other teleost {miRNomes}. In addition, small {RNA} sequencing data from brain, heart, testis, and ovary in both stickleback and zebrafish identified suites of mature {miRNAs} that display organ-specific enrichment, many of which are evolutionarily-conserved in the brain and heart in both species. These data also supported the hypothesis that evolutionarily-conserved, organ-specific mechanisms may regulate post-transcriptional variations in {miRNA} sequence. In both stickleback and zebrafish, {miR2188}-5p was edited frequently with similar nucleotide changes in the seed sequence with organ specific editing rates, highest in the brain. In summary, Prost! is a new tool to identify and understand small {RNAs}, to help clarify a species' {miRNA} biology as shown here for an important model for the evolution of developmental mechanisms, and to provide insight into organ-enriched expression and the evolutionary conservation of {miRNA} post-transcriptional modifications.}

Transposons are an abundant source of transcriptional modulatory elements, such as gene promoters and enhancers, splicing and termination sites, and regulatory non-coding {RNAs}. Moreover, transposons have driven the evolution of host defence mechanisms that have been repurposed for gene regulation. However, dissecting the potential functional roles of transposons remains challenging owing to their evolutionary path, as well as their repetitive nature, which requires the development of specialized analytical tools. In this special issue, we present a collection of articles that lay out current paradigms in the field and discuss a vision for future research. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Crossroads between transposons and gene regulation'.}

abstract = {Next-generation sequencing approaches have fundamentally changed the types of questions that can be asked about gene function and regulation. With the goal of approaching truly genome-wide quantifications of all the interaction partners and downstream effects of particular genes, these quantitative assays have allowed for an unprecedented level of detail in exploring biological interactions. However, many challenges remain in our ability to accurately describe and quantify the interactions that take place in those hard to reach and extremely repetitive regions of our genome comprised mostly of transposable elements ({TEs}). Tools dedicated to {TE}-derived sequences have lagged behind, making the inclusion of these sequences in genome-wide analyses difficult. Recent improvements, both computational and experimental, allow for the better inclusion of {TE} sequences in genomic assays and a renewed appreciation for the importance of {TE} biology. This review will discuss the recent improvements that have been made in the computational analysis of {TE}-derived sequences as well as the areas where such analysis still proves difficult.

Here we report a similar genetic signature in 7 of 11,035 trios, with allelic fractions of 5-25\%, implying biparental inheritance of {mtDNA} in 0.06\% of offspring. However, analysing the nuclear whole genome sequence, we observe likely large rare or unique nuclear-mitochondrial {DNA} segments (mega-{NUMTs}) transmitted from the father in all 7 families. Independently detecting mega-{NUMTs} in 0.13\% of fathers, we see autosomal transmission of the haplotype. Finally, we show the haplotype allele fraction can be explained by complex concatenated {mtDNA}-derived sequences rearranged within the nuclear genome. We conclude that rare cryptic mega-{NUMTs} can resemble paternally {mtDNA} heteroplasmy, but find no evidence of paternal transmission of {mtDNA} in humans.}

Here, we focused on understanding the structure-function regulation of meiotic chromosomes by Hi-C and other omics techniques in mouse spermatogenesis across five stages. Beyond confirming recent reports regarding changes in compartmentalization and reorganization of topologically associating domains ({TADs}), we further demonstrated that chromatin loops are present prior to and after, but not at, the pachytene stage. By integrating Hi-C and {RNA}-seq data, we showed that the switching of A/B compartments between spermatogenic stages is tightly associated with meiosis-specific {mRNAs} and {piRNAs} expression. Moreover, our {ATAC}-seq data indicated that chromatin accessibility per se is not responsible for the {TAD} and loop diminishment at pachytene. Additionally, our {ChIP}-seq data demonstrated that {CTCF} and cohesin remain bound at {TAD} boundary regions throughout meiosis, suggesting that dynamic reorganization of {TADs} does not require {CTCF} and cohesin clearance.

Here, we examined the consequences of sperm {DNA} damage on the embryonic genome by single-cell whole-genome sequencing of individual blastomeres from bovine embryos produced with sperm damaged by \gamma-radiation. Sperm {DNA} damage primarily leads to fragmentation of the paternal chromosomes followed by random distribution of the chromosomal fragments over the two sister cells in the first cell division. An unexpected secondary effect of sperm {DNA} damage is the induction of direct unequal cleavages, which include the poorly understood heterogoneic cell divisions. As a result, chaotic mosaicism is common in embryos derived from fertilizations with damaged sperm. The mosaic aneuploidies, uniparental disomies, and de novo structural variation induced by sperm {DNA} damage may compromise fertility and lead to rare congenital disorders when embryos escape developmental arrest.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Chromatin dysregulation is associated with developmental disorders and cancer. Numerous methods for measuring genome-wide chromatin accessibility have been developed in the genomic era to interrogate the function of chromatin regulators. A recent technique which has gained widespread use due to speed and low input requirements with native chromatin is the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin, or {ATAC}-seq. Biologists have since used this method to compare chromatin accessibility between two cellular conditions. However, approaches for calculating differential accessibility can yield conflicting results, and little emphasis is placed on choice of normalization method during differential {ATAC}-seq analysis, especially when global chromatin alterations might be expected. {RESULTS}: Using an in vivo {ATAC}-seq data set generated in our recent report, we observed differences in chromatin accessibility patterns depending on the data normalization method used to calculate differential accessibility. This observation was further verified on published {ATAC}-seq data from yeast. We propose a generalized workflow for differential accessibility analysis using {ATAC}-seq data. We further show this workflow identifies sites of differential chromatin accessibility that correlate with gene expression and is sensitive to differential analysis using negative controls. {CONCLUSIONS}: We argue that researchers should systematically compare multiple normalization methods before continuing with differential accessibility analysis. {ATAC}-seq users should be aware of the interpretations of potential bias within experimental data and the assumptions of the normalization method implemented.}

abstract = {Background In contrast with genetics, epigenetics does not alter the {DNA} sequence. It was a widely held thought that although the epigenome undergoes a process of reprogramming during gametogenesis and early embryo development, resulting epigenetic information could not be inherited by subsequent generations. There are growing pieces of evidence, recently, indicating that parentally acquired traits due to exposure to external environmental factors can be transmitted to offsprings via epigenetic mechanisms. Amongst others, diets and/or active ingredients from certain foods can be considered as external factors and can regulate epigenetic modifications to affect parental traits. Interestingly, some of these traits are transmittable from parents to offsprings. Scope and approach In this review, we summarized the mechanisms of generational epigenetic inheritance and focused on the epigenetic modulations caused by dietary factors/food active compounds. Diets and nutrition results in traits alterations, some of which are transmissible from parents to offsprings. Strictly put, the traits that could be inherited from parents are of two types: transgeneration and intergeneration. The inheritance of epigenetic information in germ cells without direct environmental stimulus, and which leads to offspring's phenotypic variation is called \textquotedbllefttransgeneration\textquotedblright, while generations directly exposed to the initial signal or environment are considered as \textquotedblleftintergeneration\textquotedblright. Key findings and conclusions Dietary patterns including malnutrition, hyper-nutrition, special component's deficiency, all results in epigenetic alterations. If the alteration occurs in germ cells, the traits of parents can be transmitted to subsequent generations. A better understanding of the relationship between parental diet and offspring health will prevent certain related diseases, which has profound implications for the health of human and our progeny.}

However, questions remain unanswered as to how heritable information can be passed from somatic cells. Previous studies have implicated the critical involvement of {RNA} in heritable transgenerational effects, and the high degree of mobility and genomic impact of {RNAs} in all organisms is an attractive model for the efficient transfer of genetic information. {RESULTS}: We hypothesized that {RNA} may be transported from a somatic tissue, in this case the brain, of an adult male mouse to the germline, and subsequently to embryos. To investigate this, we injected one hemisphere of the male mouse striatum with an {AAV1}/9 virus expressing human pre-{MIR941} ({MIR941}). After 2, 8 and 16 weeks following injection, we used an {LNA}-based {qPCR} system to detect the presence of virus and human {MIR941} in brain, peripheral tissues and embryos, from injected male mice mated with uninjected females. Virus was never detected outside of the brain. Verification of single bands of the correct size for {MIR941} was performed using Sanger sequencing while quantitation demonstrated that a small percentage (\~ 1-8\%) of {MIR941} is transported to the germline and to embryos in about a third of the cases. {CONCLUSIONS}: We show that somatic {RNA} can be transported to the germline and passed on to embryos, thereby providing additional evidence of a role for {RNA} in somatic cell-derived intergenerational effects.}

In this study, we developed {mirTools} 2.0, an updated version of {mirTools} 1.0, which includes the following new features. (1) From {miRNA} discovery in {mirTools} 1.0, {mirTools} 2.0 allows users to detect and profile various types of {ncRNAs}, such as {miRNA}, {tRNA}, {snRNA}, {snoRNA}, {rRNA}, and {piRNA}. (2) From {miRNA} profiling in {mirTools} 1.0, {mirTools} 2.0 allows users to identify {miRNA}-targeted genes and performs detailed functional annotation of {miRNA} targets, including Gene Ontology, {KEGG} pathway and protein-protein interaction. (3) From comparison of two samples for differentially expressed {miRNAs} in {mirTools} 1.0, {mirTools} 2.0 allows users to detect differentially expressed {ncRNAs} between two experimental groups or among multiple samples. (4) Other significant improvements include strategies used to detect novel {miRNAs} and {piRNAs}, more taxonomy categories to discover more known {miRNAs} and a stand-alone version of {mirTools} 2.0. In conclusion, we believe that {mirTools} 2.0 (122.228.158.106/mr2\_dev and centre.bioinformatics.zj.cn/mr2\_dev) will provide researchers with more detailed insight into small {RNA} transcriptomes.}

abstract = {Parents' stressful experiences can influence an offspring's vulnerability to many pathological conditions, including psychopathologies, and their effects may even endure for several generations. Nevertheless, the cause of this phenomenon has not been determined, and only recently have scientists turned to epigenetics to answer this question. There is extensive literature on epigenetics, but no consensus exists with regard to how and what can (and must) be considered to study and define epigenetics processes and their inheritance. In this work, we aimed to clarify and systematize these concepts. To this end, we analyzed the dynamics of epigenetic changes over time in detail and defined three types of epigenetics: a direct form of epigenetics ({DE}) and two indirect epigenetic processes-within ({WIE}) and across ({AIE}). {DE} refers to changes that occur in the lifespan of an individual, due to direct experiences with his environment. {WIE} concerns changes that occur inside of the womb, due to events during gestation. Finally, {AIE} defines changes that affect the individual's predecessors (parents, grandparents, etc.), due to events that occur even long before conception and that are somehow (e.g., through gametes, the intrauterine environment setting) transmitted across generations. This distinction allows us to organize the main body of epigenetic evidence according to these categories and then focus on the latter ({AIE}), referring to it as a faster route of informational transmission across generations-compared with genetic inheritance-that guides human evolution in a Lamarckian (i.e., experience-dependent) manner. Of the molecular processes that are implicated in this phenomenon, well-known (methylation) and novel (non-coding {RNA}, {ncRNA}) regulatory mechanisms are converging. Our discussion of the chief methods that are used to study epigenetic inheritance highlights the most compelling technical and theoretical problems of this discipline. Experimental suggestions to expand this field are provided, and their practical and ethical implications are discussed extensively.}

abstract = {Numerous studies in humans and in animal models have demonstrated that exposure to adverse environmental conditions in early life results in long-term structural and functional changes in an organism, increasing the risk of cardiometabolic, neurobehavioural and reproductive disorders in later life. Such effects are not limited to the first generation offspring but may be transmitted to a second or a number of subsequent generations, through non-genomic mechanisms. While the transmission of 'programmed' effects through the maternal line could occur as a consequence of multiple influences, for example, altered maternal physiology, the inheritance of effects through the male line is more difficult to explain and there is much interest in a potential role for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. In this review, we will discuss the mechanisms by which induced effects may be transmitted through the paternal lineage, with a particular focus on the role of epigenetic inheritance.

abstract = {Recently interest in multi-generational epigenetic phenomena have been fuelled by highly reproducible intergenerational and transgenerational inheritance paradigms in several model organisms. Such paradigms are essential in order to begin to use genetics to unpick the mechanistic bases of how epigenetic information may be transmitted between generations; indeed great strides have been made towards understanding these mechanisms. Far less well understood is the relationship between epigenetic inheritance, ecology and evolution. In this review I focus on potential connections between laboratory studies of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance phenomena and evolutionary processes that occur in natural populations. In the first section, I consider whether transgenerational epigenetic inheritance might provide an advantage to organisms over the short term in adapting to their environment. Second, I consider whether epigenetic changes can contribute to the evolution of species by contributing to stable phenotypic variation within a population. Finally I discuss whether epigenetic changes could influence evolution by either directly or indirectly promoting {DNA} sequence changes that could impact phenotypic divergence. Additionally, I will discuss how epigenetic changes could influence the evolution of human cancer and thus be directly relevant for the development of this disease.

abstract = {Background: Epidemiological studies suggest that paternal obesity may increase the risk of fathering small for gestational age offspring. Studies in non-human mammals suggest that such associations could be mediated by {DNA} methylation changes in spermatozoa that influence offspring development in utero. Human obesity is associated with differential {DNA} methylation in peripheral blood. It is unclear, however, whether this differential {DNA} methylation is reflected in spermatozoa. We profiled genome-wide {DNA} methylation using the Illumina {MethylationEPIC} array in matched human blood and sperm from lean (discovery n=47; replication n=21) and obese (n=22) males to analyse tissue covariation of {DNA} methylation, and identify whether this covariation is influenced by obesity. Results: {DNA} methylation signatures of human blood and spermatozoa are highly discordant, and methylation levels are correlated at only a minority of {CpG} sites (\~1\%). While at the majority of these sites, {DNA} methylation appears to be influenced by genetic variation, obesity-associated {DNA} methylation in blood was not generally reflected in spermatozoa, and obesity did not influence covariation patterns. However, one cross-tissue obesity-specific hypermethylated site (cg19357369; chr4:2429884; P=8.{95E}-8; beta=0.02) was identified, warranting replication and further investigation. When compared to a wide range of human somatic tissue samples (n=5,917), spermatozoa displayed differential {DNA} methylation in pathways enriched in transcriptional regulation. Conclusions: Human sperm displays a unique {DNA} methylation profile that is highly discordant to, and practically uncorrelated with, that of matched peripheral blood. Obesity only nominally influences sperm {DNA} methylation, making it an unlikely mediator of intergenerational effects of metabolic traits.}

Many epigenetic studies have been done using plants, rodent, and human models, but fewer have focused on domestic livestock species. The goal of this review is to present current epigenetic findings in livestock species (cattle, pigs, sheep and poultry). Much of this research examined epigenetic effects following exposure to toxicants, nutritional changes or infectious disease in those animals directly exposed, or in the offspring they produced. A limited number of studies in domestic animals have examined epigenetic transgenerational inheritance in the absence of continued exposures. One example used a porcine model to investigate the effect that feeding males a diet supplemented with micronutrients had on liver {DNA} methylation and muscle mass in grand-offspring (the transgenerational F2 generation). Further research into how epigenetic mechanisms affect the health and production traits of domestic livestock and their offspring is important to elucidate. Copyright \copyright 2020 The Authors.

In C. elegans nematodes, small {RNAs} are transmitted across generations to establish a transgenerational memory trace of ancestral environments and distinguish self from non-self genes. Inheritance of small {RNAs} is regulated by dedicated machinery and carryover of aberrant heritable small {RNA} responses was shown to be maladaptive and to induce sterility. Here we show that various types of stress (starvation, high temperatures, and high osmolarity) but not non-stressful changes in cultivation conditions, lead to resetting of small {RNA} inheritance. We found that stress leads to a genome-wide reduction in heritable small {RNA} levels and that mutants defective in different stress pathways exhibit irregular {RNAi} inheritance dynamics. Moreover, we discovered that resetting of heritable {RNAi} is orchestrated by {MAPK} pathway factors, the transcription factor {SKN}-1, and the {MET}-2 methyltransferase. Termination of small {RNA} inheritance, and the fact that this process depends on stress, could protect from run-on of environment-irrelevant heritable gene regulation.}

Early life exposure to {EDCs} may permanently alter phenotypes through to adulthood. In addition, the effects of {EDCs} may not be isolated to a single generation - offspring may indirectly be impacted, via non-genetic processes. Here, we analyzed the effects of paternal atrazine exposure on behavioral traits (distance moved, exploration, bottom-dwelling time, latency to enter the top zone, and interaction with a mirror) and whole-brain {mRNA} of genes involved in the serotonergic system regulation (slc6a4a, slc6a4b, {htr1Aa}, {htr1B}, {htr2B}) of zebrafish (Danio rerio). F0 male {zebraFIsh} were exposed to atrazine at 0.3, 3 or 30 part per billion (ppb) during early juvenile development, the behavior of F1 progeny was tested at adulthood, and the effect of 0.3 ppb atrazine treatment on {mRNA} transcription was quantified. Paternal exposure to atrazine significantly reduced interactions with a mirror (a proxy for aggression) and altered the latency to enter the top zone of a tank in unexposed F1 offspring. Bottom-dwelling time (a proxy for anxiety) also appeared to be somewhat affected, and activity (distance moved) was reduced in the context of aggression. slc6a4a and {htr1Aa} {mRNA} transcript levels were found to correlate positively with anxiety levels in controls, but we found that this relationship was disrupted in the 0.3 ppb atrazine treatment group. Overall, paternal atrazine exposure resulted in alterations across a variety of behavioral traits and showed signs of serotonergic system dysregulation, demonstrating intergenerational effects. Further research is needed to explore transgenerational effects on behavior and possible mechanisms underpinning behavioral effects.}

Here, the effects of betaine on hippocampal expression of neurogenesis genes and their {DNA} methylation status across three generations are investigated. {METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: Pregnant rats (F0) are fed control and betaine-supplemented diets throughout gestation and lactation. Female F1 and F2 offspring at weaning, together with the F0 dams, are used in the study. Hippocampal expression of aromatase, estrogen receptor \alpha, and estrogen-related receptor \beta is downregulated in F1, together with the estrogen-responsive insulin-like growth factor 2/insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 ({IGF}-2/{IGFBP2}) genes. However, all these genes are upregulated in F2, which follows the same pattern of F0. In agreement with changes in {mRNA} expression, the imprinting control region ({ICR}) of {IGF}-2 gene is hypomethylated in F1 but hypermethylated in F2 and F0. In contrast, the promoter {DNA} methylation status of all the affected genes is hypermethylated in F1 but hypomethylated in F2 and F0. Methyl transfer enzymes, such as betaine homocysteine methyltransferase and {DNA} methyltransferase 1, follow the same pattern of transgenerational inheritance. {CONCLUSION}: These results indicate that betaine exerts a transgenerational effect on hippocampal expression of estrogen-responsive genes in rat offspring, which is associated with corresponding alterations in {DNA} methylation on {ICR} of {IGF}-2 gene and the promoter of affected genes. \copyright 2020 {WILEY}-{VCH} Verlag {GmbH} \& Co. {KGaA}, Weinheim.}

Owing to these unique animal models, our ability to study and manipulate {\SSCs} has dramatically increased, which complements the availability of other advanced assisted reproductive technologies and various genome editing tools. These animal models can advance our knowledge of {\SSCs}, testis tissue morphogenesis and development, germ-somatic cell interactions, and mechanisms that control spermatogenesis. Equally important, these animal models can have a wide range of experimental and potential clinical applications in fertility preservation of prepubertal cancer patients, and genetic conservation of endangered species. Moreover, these models allow experimentations that are otherwise difficult or impossible to be performed directly in the target species. Examples include proof-of-principle manipulation of germ cells for correction of genetic disorders or investigation of potential toxicants or new drugs on human testis formation or function.

We observe that the best performing {PWM} for a given {TF} often belongs to another {TF}, usually from the same family. Occasionally, binding specificity is correlated with the structural class of the {DNA} binding domain, indicated by good cross-family performance measures. Benchmarking-based selection of family-representative motifs is more effective than motif clustering-based approaches. Overall, there is good agreement between in vitro and in vivo performance measures. However, for some in vivo experiments, the best performing {PWM} is assigned to an unrelated {TF}, indicating a binding mode involving protein-protein cooperativity. {CONCLUSIONS}: In an all-against-all setting, we compute more than 18 million performance measure values for different {PWM}-experiment combinations and offer these results as a public resource to the research community. The benchmarking protocols are provided via a web interface and as docker images.

However, differences in sequencing depth and signal-to-noise ratios in the data from different experiments can hinder our ability to identify real biological variation from raw epigenomic data. Proper normalization is required prior to data analysis to gain meaningful insights. Most existing methods for data normalization standardize signals by rescaling either background regions or peak regions, assuming that the same scale factor is applicable to both background and peak regions. While such methods adjust for differences in sequencing depths, they do not address differences in the signal-to-noise ratios across different experiments. We developed a new data normalization method, called S3norm, that normalizes the sequencing depths and signal-to-noise ratios across different data sets simultaneously by a monotonic nonlinear transformation. We show empirically that the epigenomic data normalized by our method, compared to existing methods, can better capture real biological variation, such as impact on gene expression regulation. \copyright The Author(s) 2020.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: A growing body of evidence suggests that certain epiphenotypes can be passed across generations via both the male and female germlines of mammals. These observations have been difficult to explain owing to a global loss of the majority of known epigenetic marks present in parental chromosomes during primordial germ cell development and after fertilization. {RESULTS}: By integrating previously published {BS}-seq, {DNase}-seq, {ATAC}-seq, and {RNA}-seq data collected during multiple stages of primordial germ cell and pre-implantation development, we find that the methylation status of the majority of {CpGs} genome-wide is restored after global de-methylation, despite the fact that global {CpG} methylation drops to 10\% in primordial germ cells and 20\% in the inner cell mass of the blastocyst. We estimate the proportion of such {CpGs} with preserved methylation status to be 78\%. Further, we find that {CpGs} at sites bound by transcription factors during the global re-methylation phases of germline and embryonic development remain hypomethylated across all developmental stages observed. On the other hand, {CpGs} at sites not bound by transcription factors during the global re-methylation phase have high methylation levels prior to global de-methylation, become de-methylated during global de-methylation, and then become re-methylated. {CONCLUSIONS}: The results suggest that transcription factors can act as carriers of epigenetic information during germ cell and pre-implantation development by ensuring that the methylation status of {CpGs} is maintained. These findings provide the basis for a mechanistic description of trans-generational inheritance of epigenetic information in mammals.}

abstract = {Everything we do today is becoming more and more reliant on the use of computers. The field of biology is no exception; but most biologists receive little or no formal preparation for the increasingly computational aspects of their discipline. In consequence, informal training courses are often needed to plug the gaps; and the demand for such training is growing worldwide. To meet this demand, some training programs are being expanded, and new ones are being developed. Key to both scenarios is the creation of new course materials. Rather than starting from scratch, however, it's sometimes possible to repurpose materials that already exist. Yet finding suitable materials online can be difficult: They're often widely scattered across the internet or hidden in their home institutions, with no systematic way to find them. This is a common problem for all digital objects. The scientific community has attempted to address this issue by developing a set of rules (which have been called the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable [{FAIR}] principles) to make such objects more findable and reusable. Here, we show how to apply these rules to help make training materials easier to find, (re)use, and adapt, for the benefit of all.}

abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: With the reduction in price of next-generation sequencing technologies, gene expression profiling using {RNA}-seq has increased the scope of sequencing experiments to include more complex designs, such as designs involving repeated measures. In such designs, {RNA} samples are extracted from each experimental unit at multiple time points. The read counts that result from {RNA} sequencing of the samples extracted from the same experimental unit tend to be temporally correlated. Although there are many methods for {RNA}-seq differential expression analysis, existing methods do not properly account for within-unit correlations that arise in repeated-measures designs. {RESULTS}: We address this shortcoming by using normalized log-transformed counts and associated precision weights in a general linear model pipeline with continuous autoregressive structure to account for the correlation among observations within each experimental unit. We then utilize parametric bootstrap to conduct differential expression inference. Simulation studies show the advantages of our method over alternatives that do not account for the correlation among observations within experimental units. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: We provide an R package {rmRNAseq} implementing our proposed method (function {TC\_CAR1}) at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/{rmRNAseq}/index.html.

abstract = {The term 'extracellular vesicles' refers to a heterogeneous population of vesicular bodies of cellular origin that derive either from the endosomal compartment (exosomes) or as a result of shedding from the plasma membrane (microvesicles, oncosomes and apoptotic bodies). Extracellular vesicles carry a variety of cargo, including {RNAs}, proteins, lipids and {DNA}, which can be taken up by other cells, both in the direct vicinity of the source cell and at distant sites in the body via biofluids, and elicit a variety of phenotypic responses. Owing to their unique biology and roles in cell-cell communication, extracellular vesicles have attracted strong interest, which is further enhanced by their potential clinical utility. Because extracellular vesicles derive their cargo from the contents of the cells that produce them, they are attractive sources of biomarkers for a variety of diseases. Furthermore, studies demonstrating phenotypic effects of specific extracellular vesicle-associated cargo on target cells have stoked interest in extracellular vesicles as therapeutic vehicles. There is particularly strong evidence that the {RNA} cargo of extracellular vesicles can alter recipient cell gene expression and function. During the past decade, extracellular vesicles and their {RNA} cargo have become better defined, but many aspects of extracellular vesicle biology remain to be elucidated. These include selective cargo loading resulting in substantial differences between the composition of extracellular vesicles and source cells; heterogeneity in extracellular vesicle size and composition; and undefined mechanisms for the uptake of extracellular vesicles into recipient cells and the fates of their cargo. Further progress in unravelling the basic mechanisms of extracellular vesicle biogenesis, transport, and cargo delivery and function is needed for successful clinical implementation. This Review focuses on the current state of knowledge pertaining to packaging, transport and function of {RNAs} in extracellular vesicles and outlines the progress made thus far towards their clinical applications.}

However, because of genetic diversity and the diploid nature of the human genome, we hypothesize that using a generic reference could lead to incorrectly mapped reads and bias downstream results. {RESULTS}: We show that accounting for genetic variation using a modified reference genome or a de novo assembled genome can alter histone {H3K4me1} and {H3K27ac} {ChIP}-seq peak calls either by creating new personal peaks or by the loss of reference peaks. Using permissive cutoffs, modified reference genomes are found to alter approximately 1\% of peak calls while de novo assembled genomes alter up to 5\% of peaks. We also show statistically significant differences in the amount of reads observed in regions associated with the new, altered, and unchanged peaks. We report that short insertions and deletions (indels), followed by single nucleotide variants ({SNVs}), have the highest probability of modifying peak calls. We show that using a graph personalized genome represents a reasonable compromise between modified reference genomes and de novo assembled genomes. We demonstrate that altered peaks have a genomic distribution typical of other peaks. {CONCLUSIONS}: Analyzing epigenomic datasets with personalized and graph genomes allows the recovery of new peaks enriched for indels and {SNVs}. These altered peaks are more likely to differ between individuals and, as such, could be relevant in the study of various human phenotypes.}

Although these environmental manipulations are known to delay symptom onset and progression in a variety of neurological and psychiatric conditions, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood. A notable candidate molecular mechanism is that of {microRNA}, a family of small noncoding {RNAs} that are important regulators of gene expression. Research investigating the many diverse roles of {microRNAs} has greatly expanded over the past decade, with several promising preclinical and clinical studies highlighting the role of dysregulated {microRNA} expression (in the brain, blood and other peripheral systems) in understanding the aetiology of disease. Altered {microRNA} levels have also been described following environmental interventions such as exercise and environmental enrichment in non-clinical populations and wild-type animals, as well as in some brain disorders and associated preclinical models. Recent studies exploring the effects of stimulating environments on {microRNA} levels in the brain have revealed an array of changes that are likely to have important downstream effects on gene expression, and thus may regulate a variety of cellular processes. Here we review literature that explores the differential expression of {microRNAs} in rodents following environmental enrichment and exercise, in both healthy control animals and preclinical models of relevance to neurological and psychiatric disorders.

Accurate control of pericentric heterochromatin is required for meiotic cell divisions and production of fertile and epigenetically intact spermatozoa. In this study, we demonstrate that pericentric heterochromatin is expressed during mouse spermatogenesis to produce major satellite repeat ({MSR}) transcripts. We show that the endonuclease {DICER} localizes to the pericentric heterochromatin in the testis. Furthermore, {DICER} forms complexes with {MSR} transcripts, and their processing into small {RNAs} is compromised in Dicer1 knockout mice leading to an elevated level of {MSR} transcripts in meiotic cells. We also show that defective {MSR} forward transcript processing in Dicer1 {cKO} germ cells is accompanied with reduced recruitment of {SUV39H2} and {H3K9me3} to the pericentric heterochromatin and meiotic chromosome missegregation. Altogether, our results indicate that the physiological role of {DICER} in maintenance of male fertility extends to the regulation of pericentric heterochromatin through direct targeting of {MSR} transcripts. \copyright The Author(s) 2020.

In nature, hierarchies offer a tradeoff between reduction of in-group fighting between males, at the expense of an asymmetric sharing of resources. Early life experiences and stress are known to influence the rank an individual attains in adulthood, but the associated cellular and synaptic alterations are poorly understood. Using a maternal separation protocol, we show that care-deprived mice display a long-lasting submissive phenotype, increased social recognition, and enhanced explorative behavior. These alterations are consistent with an adaptation that favors exploration rather than confrontation within a group setting. At the neuronal level, these animals display dendritic atrophy and enhanced inhibitory synaptic inputs in medial prefrontal cortex ({mPFC}) neurons. To determine what could underlie this synaptic modification, we first assessed global gene expression changes via {RNAseq}, and next focused on a smaller subset of putatively altered synaptic receptors that could explain the changes in synaptic inhibition. Using different cohorts of maternally deprived mice, we validated a significant increase in the expression of Npy1r, a receptor known to play a role in maternal care, anxiety, foraging, and regulation of group behavior. Using electrophysiological recordings in adult mice while blocking {NPY1R} signaling, we determined that this receptor plays a key role in enhancing {GABAergic} currents in mice that experience maternal deprivation. Taken together, our work highlights the potential of regulating {NPY1R} in social anxiety disorders and the alterations induced in brain circuitry as a consequence of early life stress and adversity.}

abstract = {The arrangement of hypotheses in a hierarchical structure (e.g., phylogenies, cell types) appears in many research fields and indicates different resolutions at which data can be interpreted. A common goal is to find a representative resolution that gives high sensitivity to identify relevant entities (e.g., microbial taxa or cell subpopulations) that are related to a phenotypic outcome (e.g. disease status) while controlling false detections, therefore providing a more compact view of detected entities and summarizing characteristics shared among them. Current methods, either performing hypothesis tests at an arbitrary resolution or testing hypotheses at all possible resolutions leading to nested results, are suboptimal. Moreover, they are not flexible enough to work in situations where each entity has multiple features to consider and different resolutions might be required for different features. For example, in single cell {RNA}-seq data, an increasing focus is to find differential state genes that change expression within a cell subpopulation in response to an external stimulus. Such differential expression might occur at different resolutions (e.g., all cells or a small set of cells) for different genes. Our new algorithm {treeclimbR} is designed to fill this gap by exploiting a hierarchical tree of entities, proposing multiple candidates that capture the latent signal and pinpointing branches or leaves that contain features of interest, in a data-driven way. It outperforms currently available methods on synthetic data, and we highlight the approach on various applications, including microbiome and {microRNA} surveys as well as single cell cytometry and {RNA}-seq datasets. With the emergence of various multi-resolution genomic datasets, {treeclimbR} provides a thorough inspection on entities across resolutions and gives additional flexibility to uncover biological associations.}

Since the first essentially complete eukaryotic proteome was reported1, advances in mass-spectrometry-based proteomics2 have enabled increasingly comprehensive identification and quantification of the human proteome3-6. However, there have been few comparisons across species7,8, in stark contrast with genomics initiatives9. Here we use an advanced proteomics workflow-in which the peptide separation step is performed by a microstructured and extremely reproducible chromatographic system-for the in-depth study of 100 taxonomically diverse organisms. With two million peptide and 340,000 stringent protein identifications obtained in a standardized manner, we double the number of proteins with solid experimental evidence known to the scientific community. The data also provide a large-scale case study for sequence-based machine learning, as we demonstrate by experimentally confirming the predicted properties of peptides from Bacteroides uniformis. Our results offer a comparative view of the functional organization of organisms across the entire evolutionary range. A remarkably high fraction of the total proteome mass in all kingdoms is dedicated to protein homeostasis and folding, highlighting the biological challenge of maintaining protein structure in all branches of life. Likewise, a universally high fraction is involved in supplying energy resources, although these pathways range from photosynthesis through iron sulfur metabolism to carbohydrate metabolism. Generally, however, proteins and proteomes are remarkably diverse between organisms, and they can readily be explored and functionally compared at www.proteomesoflife.org.}

Here, we uncover developmental pluripotency associated 2 and 4 ({DPPA2}/4) as epigenetic priming factors that establish a permissive epigenetic landscape at a subset of developmentally important bivalent promoters characterized by low expression and poised {RNA}-polymerase. Differentiation assays reveal that Dppa2/4 double knockout mouse embryonic stem cells fail to exit pluripotency and differentiate efficiently. {DPPA2}/4 bind both {H3K4me3}-marked and bivalent gene promoters and associate with {COMPA\SS}- and Polycomb-bound chromatin. Comparing knockout and inducible knockdown systems, we find that acute depletion of {DPPA2}/4 results in rapid loss of {H3K4me3} from key bivalent genes, while {H3K27me3} is initially more stable but lost following extended culture. Consequently, upon {DPPA2}/4 depletion, these promoters gain {DNA} methylation and are unable to be activated upon differentiation. Our findings uncover a novel epigenetic priming mechanism at developmental promoters, poising them for future lineage-specific activation.}

Although genome-wide gene expression assays such as {RNA} sequencing include transposon-derived transcripts, most computational analytical tools discard or misinterpret {TE}-derived reads. Emerging approaches are improving the identification of expressed {TE} loci and helping to discriminate {TE} transcripts that permit {TE} mobilization from chimeric gene-{TE} transcripts or pervasive transcription.

Although publishing and conference participation are often highlighted, recent research has called attention to the prevalence of gender imbalance in citations. Because of the downstream effects of citations on visibility and career advancement, understanding the role of gender in citation practices is vital for addressing scientific inequity. Here, we investigate whether gendered patterns are present in neuroscience citations. Using data from five top neuroscience journals, we find that reference lists tend to include more papers with men as first and last author than would be expected if gender were unrelated to referencing. Importantly, we show that this imbalance is driven largely by the citation practices of men and is increasing over time as the field diversifies. We assess and discuss possible mechanisms and consider how researchers might approach these issues in their own work.}

Most duplicated genes are eliminated, and factors that influence the retention of persisting duplicates remain poorly understood. We describe a systematic complex genetic interaction analysis with yeast paralogs derived from the whole-genome duplication event. Mapping of digenic interactions for a deletion mutant of each paralog, and of trigenic interactions for the double mutant, provides insight into their roles and a quantitative measure of their functional redundancy. Trigenic interaction analysis distinguishes two classes of paralogs: a more functionally divergent subset and another that retained more functional overlap. Gene feature analysis and modeling suggest that evolutionary trajectories of duplicated genes are dictated by combined functional and structural entanglement factors.

abstract = {{ATAC}-seq is widely used to measure chromatin accessibility and identify open chromatin regions ({OCRs}). {OCRs} usually indicate active regulatory elements in the genome and are directly associated with the gene regulatory network. The identification of differential accessibility regions ({DARs}) between different biological conditions is critical in determining the differential activity of regulatory elements. Differential analysis of {ATAC}-seq shares many similarities with differential expression analysis of {RNA}-seq data. However, the distribution of {ATAC}-seq signal intensity is different from that of {RNA}-seq data, and higher sensitivity is required for {DARs} identification. Many different tools can be used to perform differential analysis of {ATAC}-seq data, but a comprehensive comparison and benchmarking of these methods is still lacking. Here, we used simulated datasets to systematically measure the sensitivity and specificity of six different methods. We further discussed the statistical and signal density cut-offs in the differential analysis of {ATAC}-seq by applying them to real data. Batch effects are very common in high-throughput sequencing experiments. We illustrated that batch-effect correction can dramatically improve sensitivity in the differential analysis of {ATAC}-seq data. Finally, we developed a user-friendly package, {BeCorrect}, to perform batch effect correction and visualization of corrected {ATAC}-seq signals in a genome browser.}

Multiple epigenetic mechanisms have been associated with social insect plasticity, with {DNA} methylation being explored to the greatest extent. {DNA} methylation is thought to play a role in caste determination in Apis mellifera, and other social insects, but there is limited knowledge on its role in other bee species. In this study, we analyzed whole genome bisulfite sequencing and {RNA}-seq data sets from head tissue of reproductive and sterile castes of the eusocial bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We found that genome-wide methylation in B. terrestris is similar to other holometabolous insects and does not differ between reproductive castes. We did, however, find differentially methylated genes between castes, which are enriched for multiple biological processes including reproduction. However, we found no relationship between differential methylation and differential gene expression or differential exon usage between castes. Our results also indicate high intercolony variation in methylation. These findings suggest that methylation is associated with caste differences but may serve an alternate function, other than direct caste determination in this species. This study provides the first insights into the nature of a bumblebee caste-specific methylome as well as its interaction with gene expression and caste-specific alternative splicing, providing greater understanding of the role of methylation in phenotypic plasticity within social bee species. Future experimental work is needed to determine the function of methylation and other epigenetic mechanisms in insects. \copyright 2019 The Author(s).

However, single-cell clonal expansion produces heterogeneous methylomes, thus raising the question of how the {DNA} methylome remains stable despite constant epigenetic drift. Here, we report that a clonal population of {DNA} (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 ({DNMT1})-only cells produces a heterogeneous methylome, which is robustly propagated on cell expansion and differentiation. Our data show that {DNMT1} has imprecise maintenance activity and possibly possesses weak de novo activity, leading to spontaneous 'epimutations'. However, these epimutations tend to be corrected through a neighbor-guided mechanism, which is likely to be enabled by the environment-sensitive de novo activity ('tuner') and maintenance activity ('stabilizer') of {DNMT1}. By generating base-resolution maps of de novo and maintenance activities, we find that {H3K9me2}/3-marked regions show enhanced de novo activity, and {CpG} islands have both poor maintenance and de novo activities. The imprecise epigenetic machinery coupled with neighbor-guided correction may be a fundamental mechanism underlying robust yet flexible epigenetic inheritance.}

They contribute significantly to a cell's mass of {DNA} and have the potential to become involved in host gene control. We argue that the suppression of their activities by methylation of the C-phosphate-G ({CpG}) dinucleotide in {DNA} is essential for their long-term accommodation in the host genome and, therefore, to its expansion. An inevitable consequence of cytosine methylation is an increase in C-to-T transition mutations via deamination, which causes {CpG} loss. Cytosine deamination is often needed for {TEs} to take on regulatory functions in the host genome. Our study of the whole-genome sequences of 53 organisms showed a positive correlation between the size of a genome and the percentage of {TEs} it contains, as well as a negative correlation between size and the {CpG} observed/expected (O/E) ratio in both {TEs} and the host {DNA}. {TEs} are seldom found at promoters and transcription start sites, but they are found more at enhancers, particularly after they have accumulated C-to-T and other mutations. Therefore, the methylation of {TE} {DNA} allows for genome expansion and also leads to new opportunities for gene control by {TE}-based regulatory sites. Copyright \copyright 2020 the Author(s).

Here we briefly examine the literature on transgenerational actions of endocrine disrupting chemicals ({EDCs}) on brain and behavior and their underlying epigenetic mechanisms including: {DNA} methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding {RNAs}. We stress that epigenetic modifications need to be examined in a synergistic manner, as they act together in situ on chromatin to change transcription. Next we highlight recent work from one of our laboratories ({VGC}). The data provide new evidence that the sperm genome is poised for transcription. In developing sperm, gene enhancers and promoters are accessible for transcription and these activating motifs are also found in preimplantation embryos. Thus, {DNA} modifications associated with transcription factors during fertilization, in primordial germ cells ({PGCs}), and/or during germ cell maturation may be passed to offspring. We discuss the implications of this model to {EDC} exposures and speculate on whether natural variation in hormone levels during fertilization and {PGC} migration may impart transgenerational effects on brain and behavior. Lastly we discuss how this mechanism could apply to neural sexual differentiation. Copyright \copyright 2020. Published by Elsevier Inc.}

These studies suggested that sperm nuclear quality declined after release from the testis, but the site where this loss of fertility occurs has not been localized. {METHODS}: We performed {ICSI} with testicular, caput, and cauda epididymal sperm from infertile Tnp1-/-Tnp2+/- mutant mice, which have a minimal level of transition nuclear proteins and are sterile by natural mating. {RESULTS}: When the heads of motile sperm from the testis or caput epididymis of Tnp1-/-Tnp2+/- males were injected into enucleated mouse oocytes, sperm chromosomes showed no difference from those of wild-type mice, but the chromosomes from sperm taken from the cauda epididymis of mutant males showed increased abnormalities. Injection of testicular or caput epididymal sperm from Tnp1-/-Tnp2+/- males into intact oocytes resulted in normal embryonic and fetal development and yields of liveborn equivalent to wild-type, but cauda sperm from Tnp1-/-Tnp2-/- mice produced lower implantation rates and yields of liveborn than did those from wild-type mice. {CONCLUSIONS}: These results demonstrate that in mice with sperm chromatin abnormalities, the decline in fertility of sperm with {ICSI} occurs after the caput epididymis. The advantage of using caput epididymal sperm for {ICSI} in certain situations may be considered as an approach to be tested in human assisted reproduction.}

abstract = {For most biological processes, organisms must respond to extrinsic cues, while maintaining essential gene expression programmes. Although studied extensively in single cells, it is still unclear how variation is controlled in multicellular organisms. Here, we used a machine-learning approach to identify genomic features that are predictive of genes with high versus low variation in their expression across individuals, using bulk data to remove stochastic cell-to-cell variation. Using embryonic gene expression across 75 Drosophila isogenic lines, we identify features predictive of expression variation (controlling for expression level), many of which are promoter-related. Genes with low variation fall into two classes reflecting different mechanisms to maintain robust expression, while genes with high variation seem to lack both types of stabilizing mechanisms. Applying this framework to humans revealed similar predictive features, indicating that promoter architecture is an ancient mechanism to control expression variation. Remarkably, expression variation features could also partially predict differential expression after diverse perturbations in both Drosophila and humans. Differential gene expression signatures may therefore be partially explained by genetically encoded gene-specific features, unrelated to the studied treatment. \copyright 2020 The Authors.

Since the discovery of the first long noncoding {RNA} ({lncRNA}), which notably was an imprinted {lncRNA}, a body of knowledge has demonstrated pivotal roles for imprinted {lncRNAs} in regulating parental-specific expression of neighboring imprinted genes. In this Review, we will discuss the multiple functionalities attributed to {lncRNAs} and how they regulate imprinted gene expression. We also raise unresolved questions about imprinted {lncRNA} function, which may lead to new avenues of investigation. This Review is dedicated to the memory of Denise Barlow, a giant in the field of genomic imprinting and functional {lncRNAs}. With her passion for understanding the inner workings of science, her indominable spirit and her consummate curiosity, Denise blazed a path of scientific investigation that made many seminal contributions to genomic imprinting and the wider field of epigenetic regulation, in addition to inspiring future generations of scientists.}

The Y chromosome bears genes that act as their own judge, jury, and executioner in the tightly regulated meiotic surveillance pathways. These executioners are crucial for successful meiosis, yet need to be silenced during the meiotic sex chromosome inactivation window, otherwise germ cells die. Only rare transposition events to the X, where they remain subject to obligate meiotic silencing, are heritable, posing strong evolutionary constraint for the Y chromosome to persist.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Studies in non-human mammals suggest that environmental factors can influence spermatozoal {DNA} methylation, and some research suggests that spermatozoal {DNA} methylation is also implicated in conditions such as subfertility and imprinting disorders in the offspring. Together with an increased availability of cost-effective methods of interrogating {DNA} methylation, this premise has led to an increasing number of studies investigating the {DNA} methylation landscape of human spermatozoa. However, how the human spermatozoal {DNA} methylome is influenced by environmental factors is still unclear, as is the role of human spermatozoal {DNA} methylation in subfertility and in influencing offspring health. {OBJECTIVE} {AND} {RATIONALE}: The aim of this systematic review was to critically appraise the quality of the current body of literature on {DNA} methylation in human spermatozoa, summarize current knowledge and generate recommendations for future research. {SEARCH} {METHODS}: A comprehensive literature search of the {PubMed}, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases was conducted using the search terms 'semen' {OR} 'sperm' {AND} '{DNA} methylation'. Publications from 1 January 2003 to 2 March 2020 that studied human sperm and were written in English were included. Studies that used sperm {DNA} methylation to develop methodologies or forensically identify semen were excluded, as were reviews, commentaries, meta-analyses or editorial texts. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations ({GRADE}) criteria were used to objectively evaluate quality of evidence in each included publication. {OUTCOMES}: The search identified 446 records, of which 135 were included in the systematic review. These 135 studies were divided into three groups according to area of research; 56 studies investigated the influence of spermatozoal {DNA} methylation on male fertility and abnormal semen parameters, 20 studies investigated spermatozoal {DNA} methylation in pregnancy outcomes including offspring health and 59 studies assessed the influence of environmental factors on spermatozoal {DNA} methylation. Findings from studies that scored as 'high' and 'moderate' quality of evidence according to {GRADE} criteria were summarized. We found that male subfertility and abnormal semen parameters, in particular oligozoospermia, appear to be associated with abnormal spermatozoal {DNA} methylation of imprinted regions. However, no specific {DNA} methylation signature of either subfertility or abnormal semen parameters has been convincingly replicated in genome-scale, unbiased analyses. Furthermore, although findings require independent replication, current evidence suggests that the spermatozoal {DNA} methylome is influenced by cigarette smoking, advanced age and environmental pollutants. Importantly however, from a clinical point of view, there is no convincing evidence that changes in spermatozoal {DNA} methylation influence pregnancy outcomes or offspring health. {WIDER} {IMPLICATIONS}: Although it appears that the human sperm {DNA} methylome can be influenced by certain environmental and physiological traits, no findings have been robustly replicated between studies. We have generated a set of recommendations that would enhance the reliability and robustness of findings of future analyses of the human sperm methylome. Such studies will likely require multicentre collaborations to reach appropriate sample sizes, and should incorporate phenotype data in more complex statistical models. \copyright The Author(s) 2020.

We introduce {PAIRADISE} (Paired Replicate Analysis of Allelic Differential Splicing Events), a method for detecting allele-specific alternative splicing ({ASAS}) from {RNA}-seq data. Unlike conventional approaches that detect {ASAS} events one sample at a time, {PAIRADISE} aggregates {ASAS} signals across multiple individuals in a population. By treating the two alleles of an individual as paired, and multiple individuals sharing a heterozygous {SNP} as replicates, we formulate {ASAS} detection using {PAIRADISE} as a statistical problem for identifying differential alternative splicing from {RNA}-seq data with paired replicates. {PAIRADISE} outperforms alternative statistical models in simulation studies. Applying {PAIRADISE} to replicate {RNA}-seq data of a single individual and to population-scale {RNA}-seq data across many individuals, we detect {ASAS} events associated with genome-wide association study ({GWAS}) signals of complex traits or diseases. Additionally, {PAIRADISE} {ASAS} analysis detects the effects of rare variants on alternative splicing. {PAIRADISE} provides a useful computational tool for elucidating the genetic variation and phenotypic association of alternative splicing in populations.

This method enables researchers to better understand the characteristics of a single cell population without the influence of other cells. Compared to other methods of cell enrichment, such as magnetic-activated cell sorting ({MCS}), {FACS} is more flexible and accurate for cell separation due to the ability of phenotype detection by flow cytometry. In addition, {FACS} is usually capable of separating multiple cell populations simultaneously, which improves the efficiency and diversity of experiments. Although {FACS} has some limitations, it has been broadly used to purify cells for functional studies in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Here we report a protocol using fluorescence-activated cell sorting to isolate a very rare population of immune cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells ({pDC}), with high purity from the bone marrow of lupus-prone mice for in vitro functional studies of {pDC}.}

These vesicles play important roles in cell-cell communication in many processes integral to health and disease. Recent studies demonstrate that {EVs} and their cargo have influential and conserved roles in male reproduction. While {EVs} have been isolated from virtually all specialized tissues comprising the male reproductive tract, they are best characterized in the epididymis (epididymosomes) and seminal fluid (seminal fluid extracellular vesicles or prostasomes). Broadly speaking, {EVs} promote reproductive success through supporting sperm development and function, as well as influencing the physiology of female reproductive tract cells after mating. In this review, we present current knowledge on the composition and function of male reproductive tract {EV} populations in both normal physiology and pathology, and argue that their functions identify them as critical regulators of fertility and fecundity. \copyright 2020 John Wiley \& Sons A/S.

Male germline transcriptomes undergo dynamic changes after the mitosis-to-meiosis transition and have been subject to evolutionary divergence among mammals. However, the mechanisms underlying germline regulatory divergence remain undetermined. Here, we show that endogenous retroviruses ({ERVs}) influence species-specific germline transcriptomes. After the mitosis-to-meiosis transition in male mice, specific {ERVs} function as active enhancers to drive germline genes, including a mouse-specific gene set, and bear binding motifs for critical regulators of spermatogenesis, such as A-{MYB}. This raises the possibility that a genome-wide transposition of {ERVs} rewired germline gene expression in a species-specific manner. Of note, independently evolved {ERVs} are associated with the expression of human-specific germline genes, demonstrating the prevalence of {ERV}-driven mechanisms in mammals. Together, we propose that {ERVs} fine-tune species-specific transcriptomes in the mammalian germline.}

We show that active enhancer units are precisely delineated by active transcription start sites, validate that these boundaries are sufficient for capturing enhancer function, and confirm that core promoter sequences are necessary for this activity. We assay adjacent enhancers and find that their joint activity is often driven by the stronger unit within the cluster. Finally, we validate these results through functional dissection of a distal enhancer cluster using {CRISPR}-Cas9 deletions. In summary, definition of high-resolution enhancer boundaries enables deconvolution of complex regulatory loci into modular units.}

As evidence for germline non-genetic inheritance of phenotypes and diseases continues to grow in model organisms, there are fewer reports of this phenomenon in humans, due to a variety of complications in evaluating this mechanism of inheritance in humans. This review summarizes the evidence for germline-based non-genetic inheritance in humans, as well as the significant challenges and important caveats that must be considered when evaluating this process in human populations. Most reports of this process evaluate the association of a lifetime exposure in ancestors with changes in {DNA} methylation or small {RNA} expression in germ cells, as well as the association between ancestral experiences and the inheritance of a phenotype in descendants, down to great-grandchildren in some cases. Collectively, these studies provide evidence that phenotypes can be inherited in a {DNA}-independent manner; the extent to which this process contributes to disease development, as well as the cellular and molecular regulation of this process, remain largely undefined.}

Here we provide the first multiparametric integrative analysis of mammalian germ cell epigenomes comparable with that done for \textgreater100 somatic cell types by the {ENCODE} Project. Differentially expressed genes distinguishing {\SSC}- and progenitor-enriched spermatogonia showed distinct histone modification patterns, particularly for {H3K27ac} and {H3K27me3}. Motif analysis predicted transcription factors that may regulate spermatogonial subtype-specific fate, and immunohistochemistry and gene-specific chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses confirmed subtype-specific differences in target gene binding of a subset of these factors. Taken together, these results show that {\SSCs} and progenitors display distinct epigenetic profiling consistent with these spermatogonial subtypes being differentially programmed to either self-renew and maintain regenerative capacity as {\SSCs} or lose regenerative capacity and initiate lineage commitment as progenitors. \copyright 2020 The Authors.}

A subset of genes escapes X inactivation, raising questions about mechanisms that preserve their expression despite being embedded within heterochromatin. Escape gene expression differs between males and females, which can lead to physiological sex differences. We review recent studies that emphasize challenges in understanding the role of {lncRNAs} in the control of epigenetic modifications, structural features and nuclear positioning of the inactive X chromosome. Second, we highlight new findings about the distribution of genes that escape X inactivation based on single cell studies, and discuss the roles of escape genes in eliciting sex differences in health and disease.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Transposable elements ({TEs}) are a significant component of eukaryotic genomes and play essential roles in genome evolution. Mounting evidence indicates that {TEs} are highly transcribed in early embryo development and contribute to distinct biological functions and tissue morphology. {RESULTS}: We examine the epigenetic dynamics of mouse {TEs} during the development of five tissues: intestine, liver, lung, stomach, and kidney. We found that {TEs} are associated with over 20\% of open chromatin regions during development. Close to half of these accessible {TEs} are only activated in a single tissue and a specific developmental stage. Most accessible {TEs} are rodent-specific. Across these five tissues, 453 accessible {TEs} are found to create the transcription start sites of downstream genes in mouse, including 117 protein-coding genes and 144 {lincRNA} genes, 93.7\% of which are mouse-specific. Species-specific {TE}-derived transcription start sites are found to drive the expression of tissue-specific genes and change their tissue-specific expression patterns during evolution. {CONCLUSION}: Our results suggest that {TE} insertions increase the regulatory potential of the genome, and some {TEs} have been domesticated to become a crucial component of gene and regulate tissue-specific expression during mouse tissue development.}

abstract = {In recent years considerable effort has been devoted to understanding the epigenetic control of sperm development, leading to an increased appreciation of the importance of {RNA} interference pathways, and in particular {miRNAs}, as key regulators of spermatogenesis and epididymal maturation. It has also been shown that sperm are endowed with an impressive array of {miRNA} that have been implicated in various aspects of fertilization and embryo development. However, to date there have been no reports on whether the sperm {miRNA} signature is static or whether it is influenced by their prolonged maturation within the male reproductive tract. To investigate this phenomenon, we employed next-generation sequencing to systematically profile the {miRNA} signature of maturing mouse spermatozoa. In so doing we have provided the first evidence for the posttesticular modification of the sperm {miRNA} profile under normal physiological conditions. Such modifications include the apparent loss and acquisition of an impressive cohort of some 113 and 115 {miRNAs}, respectively, between the proximal and distal epididymal segments. Interestingly, the majority of these changes occur late in maturation and include the uptake of novel {miRNA} species in addition to a significant increase in many {miRNAs} natively expressed in immature sperm. Because sperm are not capable of de novo transcription, these findings identify the epididymis as an important site in establishing the sperm epigenome with the potential to influence the peri-conceptual environment of the female reproductive tract, contribute to the inheritance of acquired characteristics, and/or alter the developmental trajectory of the resulting offspring. \copyright 2015 by the Society for the Study of Reproduction, Inc.}

abstract = {Cellular metabolism has emerged as a major biological node governing cellular behaviour. Metabolic pathways fuel cellular energy needs, providing basic chemical molecules to sustain cellular homeostasis, proliferation and function. Changes in nutrient consumption or availability therefore can result in complete reprogramming of cellular metabolism towards stabilizing core metabolite pools, such as {ATP}, S-adenosyl methionine, acetyl-{CoA}, {NAD}/{NADP} and \alpha-ketoglutarate. Because these metabolites underlie a variety of essential metabolic reactions, metabolism has evolved to operate in separate subcellular compartments through diversification of metabolic enzyme complexes, oscillating metabolic activity and physical separation of metabolite pools. Given that these same core metabolites are also consumed by chromatin modifiers in the establishment of epigenetic signatures, metabolite consumption on and release from chromatin directly influence cellular metabolism and gene expression. In this Review, we highlight recent studies describing the mechanisms determining nuclear metabolism and governing the redistribution of metabolites between the nuclear and non-nuclear compartments.}

Here, using a mouse model of paternal exposure to traumatic stress, we identify circulating factors involving peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ({PPAR}) pathways in the effects of exposure to the germline. We show that exposure alters metabolic functions and pathways, particularly lipid-derived metabolites, in exposed fathers and their offspring. We collected data in a human cohort exposed to childhood trauma and observed similar metabolic alterations in circulation, suggesting conserved effects. Chronic injection of serum from trauma-exposed males into controls recapitulates metabolic phenotypes in the offspring. We identify lipid-activated nuclear receptors {PPARs} as potential mediators of the effects from father to offspring. Pharmacological {PPAR} activation in vivo reproduces metabolic dysfunctions in the offspring and grand-offspring of injected males and affects the sperm transcriptome in fathers and sons. In germ-like cells in vitro, both serum and {PPAR} agonist induce {PPAR} activation. Together, these results highlight the role of circulating factors as potential communication vectors between the periphery and the germline. \copyright 2020 The Authors.

On the contrary, junk transcripts provide the raw material for the evolution of diverse long non-coding (lnc) {RNAs} by non-adaptive mechanisms, such as constructive neutral evolution. The generation of many novel functional entities, such as {lncRNAs}, that fuels organismal complexity does not seem to be driven by strong positive selection.

abstract = {Advancing the molecular knowledge surrounding fertility and inheritance has become critical given the halving of sperm counts in the last 40 years, and the rise in complex disease which cannot be explained by genetics alone. The connection between both these trends may lie in alterations to the sperm epigenome and occur through environmental exposures. Changes to the sperm epigenome are also associated with health risks across generations such as metabolic disorders and cancer. Thus, it is imperative to identify the epigenetic modifications that escape reprogramming during spermatogenesis and embryogenesis. Here, we aimed to identify the chromatin signature(s) involved in transgenerational phenotypes in our genetic mouse model of epigenetic inheritance that overexpresses the histone demethylase {KDM1A} in their germ cells. We used sperm-specific chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by in depth sequencing ({ChIP}-seq), and computational analysis to identify whether differential enrichment of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation ({H3K4me3}), and histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation ({H3K27me3}) serve as mechanisms for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance through the paternal germline. Our analysis on the sperm of {KDM1A} transgenic males revealed specific changes in {H3K4me3} enrichment that predominantly occurred independently from bivalent {H3K4me3}/{H3K27me3} regions. Many regions with altered {H3K4me3} enrichment in sperm were identified on the paternal allele of the pre-implantation embryo. These findings suggest that sperm {H3K4me3} functions in the transmission of non-genetic phenotypes transgenerationally. \copyright ? The Author(s) 2020.

Using 34,774 joint profiles from mouse skin, we develop a computational strategy to identify cis-regulatory interactions and define domains of regulatory chromatin ({DORCs}) that significantly overlap with super-enhancers. During lineage commitment, chromatin accessibility at {DORCs} precedes gene expression, suggesting that changes in chromatin accessibility may prime cells for lineage commitment. We computationally infer chromatin potential as a quantitative measure of chromatin lineage-priming and use it to predict cell fate outcomes. {SHARE}-seq is an extensible platform to study regulatory circuitry across diverse cells in tissues.

One theory for such specificity is called cognitive epigenetic priming ({CEP}), according to which {HDACis} promote memory by facilitating the expression of neuroplasticity-related genes that have been stimulated by learning itself. In this review, we summarize the experimental evidence in support of {CEP}, describe newly discovered off-target effects of {HDACis} and highlight similarities between drug-induced and naturally occurring {CEP}. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of {CEP} is important in light of the preclinical premise of {HDACis} as cognitive enhancers. Copyright \copyright 2020 The Author(s).

Repeat-rich Y chromosomes can act as reservoirs for {TEs} ('toxic' Y effect), and incomplete epigenomic defenses during early development can lead to deleterious {TE} mobilization. Here, we contrast the dynamics of early {TE} activation in two Drosophila species with vastly different Y chromosomes of different ages. Zygotic {TE} expression is elevated in male embryos relative to females in both species, mostly due to expression of Y-linked {TEs}. Interestingly, male-biased {TE} expression diminishes across development in D. pseudoobscura, but remains elevated in D. miranda, the species with the younger and larger Y chromosome. The repeat-rich Y of D. miranda still contains many actively transcribed genes, which compromise the formation of silencing heterochromatin. Elevated {TE} expression results in more de novo insertions of repeats in males compared to females. This lends support to the idea that the 'toxic' Y chromosome can create a mutational burden in males when genome-wide defense mechanisms are compromised, and suggests a previously unappreciated epigenetic conflict on evolving Y chromosomes between transcription of essential genes and silencing of selfish {DNA}.}

abstract = {The origin and development of the spermatogenic cell lineage is reviewed, as well as spermatogonial kinetics in adult nonprimate mammals in relation to the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium, the emphasis being on spermatogonial stem cells. A hypothesis is presented for the transition from foetal germ cells, gonocytes, to adult type spermatogonia at the start of spermatogenesis. An overview is given of the present knowledge on the proliferation and differentiation of undifferentiated spermatogonia (spermatogonial stem cells and their direct descendants) and the regulation of these processes. It is concluded that the differentiation of the undifferentiated into differentiating type spermatogonia is a rather vulnerable moment during spermatogenesis and the models for studying this are described. Research into the molecular basis of the regulation of spermatogonial proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis is at its infancy and the first results are reviewed. An exciting new research tool is the spermatogonial stem cell transplantation technique which is described. Finally, reviewing the nature of human germ cell tumours it is concluded that at present there are no animal or in vitro models to study these tumours experimentally.}

abstract = {Regulation of gene expression is essential for the functioning of all eukaryotic organisms. Understanding gene expression regulation requires determining which proteins interact with regulatory elements in chromatin. {MS}-based analysis of chromatin has emerged as a powerful tool to identify proteins associated with gene regulation, as it allows studying protein function and protein complex formation in their in vivo chromatin-bound context. Total chromatin isolated from cells can be directly analyzed using {MS} or further fractionated into transcriptionally active and inactive chromatin prior to {MS}-based analysis. Newly formed chromatin that is assembled during {DNA} replication can also be specifically isolated and analyzed. Furthermore, capturing specific chromatin domains facilitates the identification of previously unknown transcription factors interacting with these domains. Finally, in recent years, advances have been made toward identifying proteins that interact with a single genomic locus of interest. In this review, we highlight the power of chromatin proteomics approaches and how these provide complementary alternatives compared with conventional affinity purification methods. Furthermore, we discuss the biochemical challenges that should be addressed to consolidate and expand the role of chromatin proteomics as a key technology in the context of gene expression regulation and epigenetics research in health and disease.

Years of research have led to models that capture experimental results in individual behavioral tasks and individual brain regions. We here advocate for taking the next step: integrating experimental results from many laboratories into suites of benchmarks that, when considered together, push mechanistic models toward explaining entire domains of intelligence, such as vision, language, and motor control. Given recent successes of neurally mechanistic models and the surging availability of neural, anatomical, and behavioral data, we believe that now is the time to create integrative benchmarking platforms that incentivize ambitious, unified models. This perspective discusses the advantages and the challenges of this approach and proposes specific steps to achieve this goal in the domain of visual intelligence with the case study of an integrative benchmarking platform called Brain-Score.

We observed that {TIPs} represent more than 50\% of large insertions and deletions (\textgreater100 bp) in the rice genome. Using a comparative genomic approach, we identified 2,041 {TIPs} between the genomes of two cultivars, japonica Nipponbare and indica 93-11. We also identified 691 {TIPs} between Nipponbare and indica Guangluai 4 in the 23-Mb collinear regions of chromosome 4. Among them, retrotransposon-based insertion polymorphisms were used to reveal the evolutionary relationships of these three cultivars. Our conservative estimates suggest that the {TIPs} generated approximately 14\% of the genomic {DNA} sequence differences between subspecies indica and japonica. It was also found that more than 10\% of {TIPs} were located in expressed gene regions, representing an important source of genetic variation. Transcript evidence implies that these {TIPs} induced a series of genetic differences between two subspecies, including interrupting host genes, creating different expression forms, drastically changing intron length, and affecting expression levels of adjacent genes. These analyses provide genome-wide insights into evolutionary history and genetic variation of rice.}

However, the molecular genetic basis of maize stalk strength remains unclear, and improvement methods remain inefficient. Here, we combined map-based cloning and association mapping and identified the gene stiff1 underlying a major quantitative trait locus for stalk strength in maize. A 27.2-kb transposable element insertion was present in the promoter of the stiff1 gene, which encodes an F-box domain protein. This transposable element insertion repressed the transcription of stiff1, leading to the increased cellulose and lignin contents in the cell wall and consequently greater stalk strength. Furthermore, a precisely edited allele of stiff1 generated through the {CRISPR}/Cas9 system resulted in plants with a stronger stalk than the unedited control. Nucleotide diversity analysis revealed that the promoter of stiff1 was under strong selection in the maize stiff-stalk group. Our cloning of stiff1 reveals a case in which a transposable element played an important role in maize improvement. The identification of stiff1 and our edited stiff1 allele pave the way for efficient improvement of maize stalk strength. \copyright 2020 American Society of Plant Biologists. All rights reserved.}

abstract = {Transposon insertion sequencing methods such as Tn-seq revolutionized microbiology by allowing the identification of genomic loci that are critical for viability in a specific environment on a genome-wide scale. While powerful, transposon insertion sequencing suffers from limited reproducibility when different analysis methods are compared. From the perspective of population biology, this may be explained by changes in mutant frequency due to chance (drift) rather than differential fitness (selection). Here, we develop a mathematical model of the population biology of transposon insertion sequencing experiments, i.e. the changes in size and composition of the transposon-mutagenized population during the experiment. We use this model to investigate mutagenesis, the growth of the mutant library, and its passage through bottlenecks. Specifically, we study how these processes can lead to extinction of individual mutants depending on their fitness and the distribution of fitness effects ({DFE}) of the entire mutant population. We find that in typical in vitro experiments few mutants with high fitness go extinct. However, bottlenecks of a size that is common in animal infection models lead to so much random extinction that a large number of viable mutants would be misclassified. While mutants with low fitness are more likely to be lost during the experiment, mutants with intermediate fitness are expected to be much more abundant and can constitute a large proportion of detected hits, i.e. false positives. Thus, incorporating the {DFEs} of randomly generated mutations in the analysis may improve the reproducibility of transposon insertion experiments, especially when strong bottlenecks are encountered. \copyright 2020 The Authors.}

Great advances in understanding biological processes result from determining the function of individual genes, a process that has classically relied on characterizing single mutations. Advances in {DNA} sequencing has made available the complete set of genetic instructions for an astonishing and growing number of species. To understand the function of this ever-increasing number of genes, a high-throughput method was developed that in a single experiment can measure the function of genes across the genome of an organism. This occurred approximately 10 years ago, when high-throughput {DNA} sequencing was combined with advances in transposon-mediated mutagenesis in a method termed transposon insertion sequencing ({TIS}). In the subsequent years, {TIS} succeeded in addressing fundamental questions regarding the genes of bacteria, many of which have been shown to play central roles in bacterial infections that result in major human diseases. The field of {TIS} has matured and resulted in studies of hundreds of species that include significant innovations with a number of transposons. Here, we summarize a number of {TIS} experiments to provide an understanding of the method and explanation of approaches that are instructive when designing a study. Importantly, we emphasize critical aspects of a {TIS} experiment and highlight the extension and applicability of {TIS} into nonbacterial species such as yeast.}

Here, a model is proposed which combines different lines of experimental evidence. First, it has been shown that somatic tissues exposed to stressing stimuli release circulating {RNA}-containing extracellular vesicles; second, epididymal spermatozoa can take up, internalize and deliver the {RNA}-containing extracellular vesicles to oocytes at fertilization; third, early embryos can process {RNA}-based information. These elements constitute the building blocks upon which the model is built. The model proposes that a continuous stream of epigenetic information flows from parental somatic tissues to the developing embryos. The flow can cross the Weismann barrier, is mediated by circulating vesicles and epididymal spermatozoa, and has the potential to generate epigenetic traits that are then stably acquired in the offspring. In a broader perspective, it emerges that a natural 'assembly line' operates continuously, aiming at passing the parental epigenetic blueprint in growing embryos. \copyright The Author(s) 2020.

We find that mentorship quality predicts the scientific impact of the papers written by protégés post mentorship without their mentors. We also find that increasing the proportion of female mentors is associated not only with a reduction in post-mentorship impact of female protégés, but also a reduction in the gain of female mentors. While current diversity policies encourage same-gender mentorships to retain women in academia, our findings raise the possibility that opposite-gender mentorship may actually increase the impact of women who pursue a scientific career.

Uncovering the molecular mechanisms is also of great interest to a better understanding of {\SSC} aging and for developing novel therapeutic strategies for degenerative diseases in view of the recent work demonstrating the pluripotent potential of the {\SSC}. Progress has recently been made in elucidating the signaling molecules and pathways that determine cell fate decisions of {\SSCs}. In this review, we first address the morphological features, phenotypic characteristics, and the potential of {\SSCs}, and then we focus on the recent advances in defining the key signaling molecules and crucial signaling pathways regulating self-renewal and differentiation of {\SSCs}. The association of aberrant expression of signaling molecules and cascades with abnormal spermatogenesis and testicular cancer are also discussed.

abstract = {Spermatogenesis is contingent upon hormones and growth factors acting through endocrine and paracrine pathways either in vivo or in vitro. Sertoli cells ({SCs}) furnish essential factors for the successful advancement of spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis. Moreover, receptors for follicle stimulating hormone ({FSH}) and testosterone, which are the main hormonal regulators of spermatogenesis, are identified on {SCs}. Testosterone, {FSH} and luteinizing hormone are known to determine the destiny of germ cells and in their absence germ cells undergo apoptosis. Bcl-2 family proteins determine one signaling pathway which seems to be crucial for the homeostasis of male gametes. In addition to paracrine signals, germ cell development also relies on signals generated by {SCs} via direct membrane contact. The regulatory peptide somatostatin has an important role in the regulation of the proliferation of the male germ cells. Activin A, follistatin and {FSH} control germ cell development. In vitro culture systems have provided initial evidence supporting the achievement of the completion of the first and second male meiotic division in vitro. This review article provides an overview of the literature regarding the hormonal pathways governing spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis.}

abstract = {The germ track is the cellular path by which genes are transmitted to future generations whereas somatic cells die with their body and do not leave direct descendants. Transposable elements ({TEs}) evolve to be silent in somatic cells but active in the germ track. Thus, the performance of most bodily functions by a sequestered soma reduces organismal costs of {TEs}. Flexible forms of gene regulation are permissible in the soma because of the self-imposed silence of {TEs}, but strict licensing of transcription and translation is maintained in the germ track to control proliferation of {TEs}. Delayed zygotic genome activation ({ZGA}) and maternally inherited germ granules are adaptations that enhance germ-track security. Mammalian embryos exhibit very early {ZGA} associated with extensive mobilization of retroelements. This window of vulnerability to retrotransposition in early embryos is an indirect consequence of evolutionary conflicts within the mammalian genome over postzygotic maternal provisioning. \copyright 2016 {WILEY} Periodicals, Inc.}

This variation arises from mutations that alter the form or function of molecular gene regulatory networks that are then filtered by natural selection. High-throughput methods for introducing mutations and characterizing their cis- and trans-regulatory effects on gene expression (particularly, transcription) are revealing how different molecular mechanisms generate regulatory variation, and studies comparing these mutational effects with variation seen in the wild are teasing apart the role of neutral and non-neutral evolutionary processes. This integration of molecular and evolutionary biology allows us to understand how the variation in gene expression we see today came to be and to predict how it is most likely to evolve in the future.}

In Caenorhabditis elegans, heritable small {RNAs} rely on {RNA}-dependent {RNA} polymerases, {RNA}-processing machinery, chromatin modifiers, and argonauts for their biogenesis and gene-regulatory effects. Importantly, many of these factors reside in evolutionary conserved germ granules that are required for maintaining germ cell identity and gene expression. Recent literature demonstrated that transient disturbance to the stability of the germ granules leads to changes in the pools of heritable small {RNAs} and the physiology of the progeny. In this piece, we discuss the heritable consequences of transient destabilization of germ granules and elaborate on the various small {RNA}-related processes that act in the germ granules. We further propose that germ granules may serve as environment sensors that translate environmental changes to inheritable small {RNA}-based responses. \copyright 2020 The Authors.}

Our data reveal a clear correlation between {CpG} density, promoter activity and accumulation of active or repressive histone marks. {CGI} boundaries define the chromatin promoter regions that will be epigenetically modified. {CpG}-rich promoters are targeted by histone modifications and histone variants, while {CpG}-poor promoters are regulated by {DNA} methylation. {CGIs} boundaries, but not transcriptional activity, are essential determinants of {H2A}.Z positioning in vicinity of the promoters, suggesting that the presence of {H2A}.Z is not related to transcriptional control. Accordingly, {H2A}.Z depletion has no impact on gene expression of arrested mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Therefore, the underlying {DNA} sequence, the promoter {CpG} density and, to a lesser extent, transcriptional activity, are key factors implicated in promoter chromatin architecture.

abstract = {The concept of cellular plasticity is particularly apt in early embryonic development, where there is a tug-of-war between the stability and flexibility of cell identity. This balance is controlled in part through epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic plasticity dictates how malleable cells are to change by adjusting the potential to initiate new transcriptional programmes. The higher the plasticity of a cell, the more readily it can adapt and change its identity in response to external stimuli such as differentiation cues. Epigenetic plasticity is regulated in part through the action of epigenetic priming factors which establish this permissive epigenetic landscape at genomic regulatory elements to enable future transcriptional changes. Recent studies on the {DNA} binding proteins Developmental Pluripotency Associated 2 and 4 (Dppa2/4) support their roles as epigenetic priming factors in facilitating cell fate transitions. Here, using Dppa2/4 as a case study, the concept of epigenetic plasticity and molecular mechanism of epigenetic priming factors will be explored. Understanding how epigenetic priming factors function is key not only to improve our understanding of the tight control of development, but also to give insights into how this goes awry in diseases of cell identity, such as cancer. \copyright 2020 The Author(s).}

In particular, our results highlight the fixation of several dnmt3-related genes following successive {WGD} throughout evolution. The rainbow trout genome offered a unique opportunity to study the early evolutionary fates of duplicated genes due to a recent round of {WGD} at the radiation of salmonids. Differences highlighted in transcriptional patterns of these genes during gametogenesis and ontogenesis in trout indicated that they might be subjected to sub- or neo-functionalisation after {WDG}.

Each of these platforms have technological limitations due to sample preparation steps, amount of material needed for sequencing, and sequencing depth requirements. These features provide a snapshot of one level of regulation in a system. The obvious next step is to integrate this information and learn how genes, proteins, and/or epigenetic factors influence the phenotype of a disease in context of the system.

Each method specifically integrates a subset of omics data using approaches such as conceptual integration, statistical integration, model-based integration, networks, and pathway data integration.

It was clearly evident that noncoding {RNAs} are undergoing a renaissance, with reports of their involvement in nearly every cellular process. Previously known classes of longer noncoding {RNAs} were shown to function by every possible means-acting catalytically, sensing physiological states through adoption of complex secondary and tertiary structures, or using their primary sequences for recognition of target sites. The many recently discovered classes of small noncoding {RNAs}, generally less than 35 nucleotides in length, most often exert their effects by guiding regulatory complexes to targets via base-pairing. With the ability to analyze the {RNA} products of the genome in ever greater depth, it has become clear that the universe of noncoding {RNAs} may extend far beyond the boundaries we had previously imagined. Thus, as much as the Symposium highlighted exciting progress in the field, it also revealed how much farther we must go to understand fully the biological impact of noncoding {RNAs}.}

Among numerous strategies, a comprehensive overview of gene expression alterations in the diseased brain could contribute for a better understanding of the {AD} pathology. In this work, we probed the differential expression of genes in different brain regions of healthy and {AD} adult subjects using data from three large transcriptomic studies: Mayo Clinic, Mount Sinai Brain Bank ({MSBB}), and {ROSMAP}. Using a combination of differential expression of gene and isoform switch analyses, we provide a detailed landscape of gene expression alterations in the temporal and frontal lobes, harboring brain areas affected at early and late stages of the {AD} pathology, respectively. Next, we took advantage of an indirect approach to assign the complex gene expression changes revealed in bulk {RNAseq} to individual cell types/subtypes of the adult brain. This strategy allowed us to identify previously overlooked gene expression changes in the brain of {AD} patients. Among these alterations, we show isoform switches in the {AD} causal gene amyloid-beta precursor protein ({APP}) and the risk gene bridging integrator 1 ({BIN1}), which could have important functional consequences in neuronal cells. Altogether, our work proposes a novel integrative strategy to analyze {RNAseq} data in {AD} and other neurodegenerative diseases based on both gene/transcript expression and regional/cell-type specificities.}

abstract = {Ever since the introduction of high-throughput sequencing following the human genome project, assembling short reads into a reference of sufficient quality posed a significant problem as a large portion of the human genome-estimated 50-69\%-is repetitive. As a result, a sizable proportion of sequencing reads is multi-mapping, i.e., without a unique placement in the genome. The two key parameters for whether or not a read is multi-mapping are the read length and genome complexity. Long reads are now able to span difficult, heterochromatic regions, including full centromeres, and characterize chromosomes from "telomere to telomere". Moreover, identical reads or repeat arrays can be differentiated based on their epigenetic marks, such as methylation patterns, aiding in the assembly process. This is despite the fact that long reads still contain a modest percentage of sequencing errors, disorienting the aligners and assemblers both in accuracy and speed. Here, I review the proposed and implemented solutions to the repeat resolution and the multi-mapping read problem, as well as the downstream consequences of reference choice, repeat masking, and proper representation of sex chromosomes. I also consider the forthcoming challenges and solutions with regards to long reads, where we expect the shift from the problem of repeat localization within a single individual to the problem of repeat positioning within pangenomes.}

abstract = {Venomous animals are a striking example of the convergent evolution of a complex trait. These animals have independently evolved an apparatus that synthesizes, stores, and secretes a mixture of toxic compounds to the target animal through the infliction of a wound. Among these distantly related animals, some can modulate and compartmentalize functionally distinct venoms related to predation and defense. A process to separate distinct venoms can occur within and across complex life cycles as well as more streamlined ontogenies, depending on their life-history requirements. Moreover, the morphological and cellular complexity of the venom apparatus likely facilitates the functional diversity of venom deployed within a given life stage. Intersexual variation of venoms has also evolved further contributing to the massive diversity of toxic compounds characterized in these animals. These changes in the biochemical phenotype of venom can directly affect the fitness of these animals, having important implications in their diet, behavior, and mating biology. In this review, we explore the current literature that is unraveling the temporal dynamics of the venom system that are required by these animals to meet their ecological functions. These recent findings have important consequences in understanding the evolution and development of a convergent complex trait and its organismal and ecological implications.}

abstract = {Pre-{mRNA} processing steps are tightly coordinated with transcription in many organisms. To determine how co-transcriptional splicing is integrated with transcription elongation and 3′ end formation in mammalian cells, we performed long-read sequencing of individual nascent {RNAs} and precision run-on sequencing ({PRO}-seq) during mouse erythropoiesis. Splicing was not accompanied by transcriptional pausing and was detected when {RNA} polymerase {II} (Pol {II}) was within 75–300 nucleotides of 3′ splice sites (3′{\SSs}), often during transcription of the downstream exon. Interestingly, several hundred introns displayed abundant splicing intermediates, suggesting that splicing delays can take place between the two catalytic steps. Overall, splicing efficiencies were correlated among introns within the same transcript, and intron retention was associated with inefficient 3′ end cleavage. Remarkably, a thalassemia patient-derived mutation introducing a cryptic 3′{\SS} improved both splicing and 3′ end cleavage of individual \beta-globin transcripts, demonstrating functional coupling between the two co-transcriptional processes as a determinant of productive gene output.}

In response to environmental stimuli, neural circuit activity engages gene regulatory mechanisms within each cell. This activity-dependent gene expression is governed, in part, by epigenetic processes that can produce persistent changes in both neural circuits and the epigenome itself. The complex interplay between circuit activity and neuronal gene regulation is vital to learning and memory, and, when disrupted, is linked to debilitating psychiatric conditions, such as substance use disorder. To develop clinical treatments, it is paramount to advance our understanding of how neural circuits and the epigenome cooperate to produce behavioral adaptation. Here, we discuss how new genetic tools, used to manipulate neural circuits and chromatin, have enabled the discovery of epigenetic processes that bring about long-lasting changes in behavior relevant to mental health and disease.

We identify evolutionary pressure to avoid conflict between sperm and somatic function as {GIMs} are enriched for testis-specific gene expression, paralogs, and isoforms.

Non-{CpG} methylation plays a critical regulatory role in cognitive function, which is mediated by the binding of {MeCP2}, the transcriptional regulator that when mutated causes Rett syndrome. However, it is unclear whether the non-{CpG} neural methylation system is restricted to mammalian species with complex cognitive abilities or has deeper evolutionary origins. To test this, we investigated brain {DNA} methylation across 12 distantly related animal lineages, revealing that non-{CpG} methylation is restricted to vertebrates. We discovered that in vertebrates, non-{CpG} methylation is enriched within a highly conserved set of developmental genes transcriptionally repressed in adult brains, indicating that it demarcates a deeply conserved regulatory program. We also found that the writer of non-{CpG} methylation, {DNMT3A}, and the reader, {MeCP2}, originated at the onset of vertebrates as a result of the ancestral vertebrate whole-genome duplication. Together, we demonstrate how this novel layer of epigenetic information assembled at the root of vertebrates and gained new regulatory roles independent of the ancestral form of the canonical {CpG} methylation. This suggests that the emergence of non-{CpG} methylation may have fostered the evolution of sophisticated cognitive abilities found in the vertebrate lineage.}

Firstly, H3 lysine 4 trimethylation ({H3K4me3}) licenses early embryonic transcription by counteracting repressive {H3K9} methylation. Secondly, an extensive interplay between transcription, {H3K36me3} and {H3K4} demethylation drives de novo {DNA} methylation required for embryogenesis. Thirdly, maternally inherited Polycomb-mediated {H3K27me3} is a potent regulator of post-implantation development.

Using a genetic mouse model in which sires have pre-existing altered {H3K4me2}/3 in sperm, we show that a {FD} diet exacerbates alterations in sperm {H3K4me3} and embryonic gene expression, leading to an increase in developmental defect severity. These findings imply that paternal {H3K4me3} is transmitted to the embryo and influences gene expression and development. It further suggests that epigenetic errors can accumulate in sperm to worsen offspring developmental outcomes. Copyright \copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}

abstract = {We have isolated vesicular structures from mouse epididymal fluid, referred to as epididymosomes. Epididymosomes have a roughly spherical aspect and a bilayer membrane, and they are heterogeneous in size and content. They originate from the epididymal epithelium, notably from the caput region, and are emitted in the epididymal lumen by way of apocrine secretion. We characterized their membranous lipid profiles in caput and cauda epididymidal fluid samples and found that epididymosomes were particularly rich in sphingomyelin ({SM}) and arachidonic acid. The proportion of {SM} increased markedly during epididymal transit and represented half the total phospholipids in cauda epididymidal epididymosomes. The cholesterol:phospholipid ratio increased from 0.26 in the caput to 0.48 in the cauda epididymidis. Measures of epididymosomal membrane anisotropy revealed that epididymosomes became more rigid during epididymal transit, in agreement with their lipid composition. In addition, we have characterized the membrane lipid pattern of murine epididymal spermatozoa during their maturation. Here, we have shown that mouse epididymal spermatozoa were distinguished by high percentages of {SM} and polyunsaturated membranous fatty acids ({PUFAs}), principally represented by arachidonic, docosapentanoic, and docosahexanoic acids. Both {SM} and {PUFA} increased throughout the epididymal tract. In particular, we observed a threefold rise in the ratio of docosapentanoic acid. Epididymal spermatozoa had a constant cholesterol:phospholipid ratio (average, 0.30) during epididymal transit. These data suggest that in contrast with epididymosomes, spermatozoal membranes seem to become more fluid during epididymal maturation.}

abstract = {The view that substance addiction is a brain disease, although widely accepted in the neuroscience community, has become subject to acerbic criticism in recent years. These criticisms state that the brain disease view is deterministic, fails to account for heterogeneity in remission and recovery, places too much emphasis on a compulsive dimension of addiction, and that a specific neural signature of addiction has not been identified. We acknowledge that some of these criticisms have merit, but assert that the foundational premise that addiction has a neurobiological basis is fundamentally sound. We also emphasize that denying that addiction is a brain disease is a harmful standpoint since it contributes to reducing access to healthcare and treatment, the consequences of which are catastrophic. Here, we therefore address these criticisms, and in doing so provide a contemporary update of the brain disease view of addiction. We provide arguments to support this view, discuss why apparently spontaneous remission does not negate it, and how seemingly compulsive behaviors can co-exist with the sensitivity to alternative reinforcement in addiction. Most importantly, we argue that the brain is the biological substrate from which both addiction and the capacity for behavior change arise, arguing for an intensified neuroscientific study of recovery. More broadly, we propose that these disagreements reveal the need for multidisciplinary research that integrates neuroscientific, behavioral, clinical, and sociocultural perspectives.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: {microRNAs} ({miRNAs}) have been shown to play essential roles in a wide range of biological processes. Many computational methods have been developed to identify targets of {miRNAs}. However, the majority of these methods depend on pre-defined features that require considerable efforts and resources to compute and often prove suboptimal at predicting {miRNA} targets. {RESULTS}: We developed a novel hybrid deep learning-based ({DL}-based) approach that is capable of predicting {miRNA} targets at a higher accuracy. This approach integrates convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) that excel in learning spatial features and recurrent neural networks ({RNNs}) that discern sequential features. Therefore, our approach has the advantages of learning both the intrinsic spatial and sequential features of {miRNA}:target. The inputs for our approach are raw sequences of {miRNAs} and genes that can be obtained effortlessly. We applied our approach on two human datasets from recently {miRNA} target prediction studies and trained two models. We demonstrated that the two models consistently outperform the previous methods according to evaluation metrics on test datasets. Comparing our approach with currently available alternatives on independent datasets shows that our approach delivers substantial improvements in performance. We also show with multiple evidences that our approach is more robust than other methods on small datasets. Our study is the first study to perform comparisons across multiple existing {DL}-based approaches on {miRNA} target prediction. Furthermore, we examined the contribution of a Max pooling layer in between the {CNN} and {RNN} and demonstrated that it improves the performance of all our models. Finally, a unified model was developed that is robust on fitting different input datasets. {CONCLUSIONS}: We present a new {DL}-based approach for predicting {miRNA} targets and demonstrate that our approach outperforms the current alternatives. We supplied an easy-to-use tool, {miTAR}, at https://github.com/tjgu/{miTAR} . Furthermore, our analysis results support that Max Pooling generally benefits the hybrid models and potentially prevents overfitting for hybrid models.}

From all the mass spectra generated, 1022 peptides allowed the identification of 146 different proteins. Identification of some of these proteins was confirmed by western blots. Furthermore, western blot showed that the protein composition of epididymosomes differed from that characterizing prostasomes; membranous vesicles secreted by the prostate. Organization of the epididymosomes proteome according to common functional features suggests that epididymosomes have multiple functions. In order to understand the origin of epididymosomes collected distally, microarray databases of caput, corpus and cauda epididymidis were analysed to determine where along the excurrent duct the encoded proteins associated to epididymosomes are synthesised. Results suggest that some proteins synthesized in the caput and corpus epididymidis are associated with epididymosomes collected distally. {CONCLUSIONS}: Epididymosomes thus transit along the excurrent duct, and vesicles collected distally represent a mixed population.}

The overall dynamics of maturation is poorly understood, and a systems level understanding of the complex maturation process will provide valuable new information about changes occurring during epididymal transport. We report the proteomes of sperm collected from the caput, corpus and cauda segments of the mouse epididymis, identifying 1536, 1720 and 1234 proteins respectively. This study identified 765 proteins that are present in sperm obtained from all three segments. We identified 1766 proteins that are potentially added (732) or removed (1034) from sperm during epididymal transit. Phenotypic analyses of the caput, corpus and cauda sperm proteomes identified 60 proteins that have known sperm phenotypes when mutated, or absent from sperm. Our analysis indicates that as much as one-third of proteins with known sperm phenotypes are added to sperm during epididymal transit. {GO} analyses revealed that cauda sperm are enriched for specific functions including sperm-egg recognition and motility, consistent with the observation that sperm acquire motility and fertilization competency during transit through the epididymis. In addition, {GO} analyses revealed that the immunity protein profile of sperm changes during sperm maturation. Finally, we identified components of the {26S} proteasome, the immunoproteasome, and a proteasome activator in mature sperm.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Mature sperm carry thousands of {RNAs}, including {mRNAs}, {lncRNAs}, {tRNAs}, {rRNAs} and {sncRNAs}, though their functional significance is still a matter of debate. Growing evidence suggests that sperm {RNAs}, especially {sncRNAs}, are selectively retained during spermiogenesis or specifically transferred during epididymis maturation, and are thus delivered to the oocyte at fertilization, providing resources for embryo development. However , a deep characterization of the {sncRNA} content of bull sperm and its expression profile across breeds is currently lacking. To fill this gap, we optimized a guanidinium-Trizol total {RNA} extraction protocol to prepare high-quality {RNA} from frozen bull sperm collected from 40 representative bulls from six breeds. Deep sequencing was performed (40 M single 50-bp reads per sample) to establish a comprehensive repertoire of cattle sperm {sncRNA}. {RESULTS}: Our study showed that it comprises mostly {piRNAs} (26\%), {rRNA} fragments (25\%), {miRNAs} (20\%) and {tRNA} fragments ({tsRNA}, 14\%). We identified 5p-halves as the predominant {tsRNA} subgroup in bull sperm, originating mostly from Gly and Glu isoacceptors. Our study also increased by \~ 50\% the sperm repertoire of known {miRNAs} and identified 2022 predicted {miRNAs}. About 20\% of sperm {miRNAs} were located within genomic clusters, expanding the list of known polycistronic pri-{miRNA} clusters and defining several networks of co-expressed {miRNAs}. Strikingly, our study highlighted the great diversity of {isomiRs}, resulting mainly from deletions and non-templated additions (A and U) at the 3p end. Substitutions within {miRNA} sequence accounted for 40\% of {isomiRs}, with {G\textgreaterA}, {U\textgreaterC} and {C\textgreaterU} substitutions being the most frequent variations. In addition, many {sncRNAs} were found to be differentially expressed across breeds. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our study provides a comprehensive overview of cattle sperm {sncRNA}, and these findings will pave the way for future work on the role of {sncRNAs} in embryo development and their relevance as biomarkers of semen fertility.}

abstract = {Extracellular microvesicles present in the epididymal fluid have been named epididymosomes. Many epididymosome-associated proteins are transferred to spermatozoa during their maturation in the excurrent duct. Epididymosomes are heterogeneous, with their size varying between 50 and 250 nm. Two distinct population of epididymosomes characterized by different protein compositions and diameters have been isolated from the bovine epididymal fluid using different centrifugation protocols. One subpopulation of epididymosomes was characterized by {CD9} and other tetraspanin partners. Transfer of proteins from these epididymosomes to maturing spermatozoa in co-incubation experiments was inhibited by antibodies against tetraspanin proteins. This suggests that this subpopulation of epididymosomes is involved in the acquisition of proteins involved in maturation by spermatozoa in the epididymis. The other population of epididymosomes was characterized by {ELSPBP1} (epididymal sperm binding protein 1), known for its affinity for the phospholipid choline group. Flow cytometric analyses showed that {ELSPBP1}-positive epididymosomes only interacted with dying or dead epididymal spermatozoa in a Zn 2 + -dependent manner. {BLVRA} (biliverdin reductase) was identified as a partner of {ELSPBP1}. This enzyme reduces biliverdin to bilirubin: two molecules with powerful anti-oxidant properties. We hypothesize that {BLVRA} is involved in an {ROS}-scavenging mechanism protecting live epididymal spermatozoa against detrimental molecules ({ROS}) released by dying cells. Therefore, it appears that there are at least two epididymosome population with distinct functions: targeting specific proteins to transiting spermatozoa by tetraspanin-mediated membrane fusion, and protection of epididymal spermatozoa against {ROS} released from dying cells. Further work is needed to understand functions of epididymosomes in epididymal physiology and sperm maturation and storage.}

Although their role in protein transfer to the sperm membrane is well documented, we report their capacity to transport {microRNAs} ({miRNAs}), which are potent regulators of posttranscriptional gene expression. Using a microperfusion technique combined with a global microarray approach, we demonstrated that epididymosomes from two discrete bovine epididymal regions (caput and cauda) possess distinct {miRNA} signatures. In addition, we also established that {miRNA} repertoires contained within epididymosomes differ from those of their parent epithelial cells, suggesting that {miRNA} populations released from the cells may be selectively sorted. Binding of {DilC12}-labeled epididymosomes to primary cultured epididymal cells was measured by flow cytometry, and the results indicated that epididymosomes from the median caput and their {miRNA} content may be incorporated into distal caput epithelial cells. Overall, these findings reveal that distinct {miRNA} repertoires are released into the intraluminal fluid in a region-specific manner and could be involved in a novel mechanism of intercellular communication throughout the epididymis via epididymosomes.}

We have previously shown that membranous vesicles called epididymosomes are involved in the transfer of epididymal-originating proteins to spermatozoa. The cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor ({MIF}) is one of these proteins but the role played by {MIF} in relation to epididymal sperm maturation still remains unclear. As this protein has already been shown to bear different functions depending on its location, we investigated its distribution along the epididymis and in different compartments of human semen. Northern and Western blot analysis as well as immunohistochemical studies show that {MIF} is expressed all along the epididymis with a higher level of transcript in the proximal segment. {MIF} is associated with two types of membranous vesicles, i.e. epididymosomes and prostasomes, the latter being prostate-originating membranous vesicles present in the semen. In semen, {MIF} is associated with spermatozoa, prostasomes as well as the soluble fraction. The amount of {MIF} in the seminal fluid varies from one individual to another but does not correlate with the amount of {MIF} associated with ejaculated spermatozoa. There is a negative correlation between the amount of sperm-associated {MIF} and the percentage of motility in different semen samples. Sperm separation using discontinuous Percoll gradient centrifugation shows a higher amount of {MIF} associated with poorly motile spermatozoa compared to highly motile spermatozoa present in the lower Percoll fraction. These results are discussed with regards to the possible involvement of {MIF} in sperm motility acquisition during the epididymal transit.}

Here, we demonstrated that {miR}-31 from Apostichopus japonicus disrupts the balance of lipid metabolism, thus resulting in cell apoptosis by targeting complement C1q tumor necrosis factor-related protein 9 ({AjCTRP9}), a novel adipokine with pleiotropic functions in immunity and metabolism. Lipidomic analysis suggested that the intercellular lipid metabolites were markedly altered, and three ceramide (Cer) species synchronously increased in the {AjCTRP9}-silenced coelomocytes. Moreover, exogenous Cer exposure significantly induced apoptosis in the coelomocytes in vivo, in agreement with findings from {miR}-31 mimic- or {AjCTRP9} small-interfering {RNA}-transfected coelomocytes. Furthermore, we found that the imbalance in sphingolipid metabolism triggered by the overproduction of Cers ultimately resulted in the activation of the apoptosis initiator caspase-8 and executioner caspase-3. Our findings provide the first direct evidence that {miR}-31 negatively modulates the expression of {AjCTRP9} and disturbance of Cer channels, thus leading to caspase-3- and caspase-8-dependent apoptosis, during the interactions between pathogens and host.}

Testosterone produced by Leydig cells of the testes is clearly the major androgen in the circulation of men and adult males of most mammalian species. However, androgen metabolites make up a significant fraction of total circulating steroids. Moreover, androgen metabolism may proceed to amplify the action of testosterone through its conversion to dihydrotestosterone ({DHT}) or its aromatization to estradiol. The distribution of androgen and estrogen receptors ({ARs} and {ERs}) within male reproductive tissues is important because of their crucial role in mediating androgen and/or estrogen action. Attempts were undertaken to discuss not only the role of aromatase and {ERs} in mediating the action of estrogens in the male, but also the importance of {DHT} in hormonal regulation of the epididymis. In the latter, alterations caused by finasteride treatment and lead-induced oxidative stress are described. Male reproductive function of the testis and epididymis reflected by the alterations in enzymatic activity, distribution of steroid hormone receptors, differences in steroid hormone levels and altered gene expression of antioxidant enzymes are also discussed.}

abstract = {Androgen is essential for maintenance of spermatogenesis in the testis and for maturation of spermatozoa in the epididymis. The effects of androgen are mediated through its receptor ({AR}), the levels of which are, in turn, regulated by androgen. Previous studies have shown that {AR} concentrations in Leydig and Sertoli cells are differentially regulated during development. The aim of the present study was to determine if cell-type-specific regulation of {AR} by androgen occurs in testicular and epididymal cells during adulthood. Adult male rats were treated with the {LHRH}-antagonist Azaline B (100 g/day) by osmotic pump for 1, 2, 3, 4, or 8 wk to suppress endogenous androgen, with identical numbers of intact control animals at each time period. An androgen replacement group was simultaneously treated with the antagonist and a synthetic androgen, 7 alpha-methyl-19-nortestosterone ({MENT}), during the final 4 wk of the experiment. Levels of nuclear {AR} protein in specific cell types were quantified by immunohistochemistry in conjunction with computer-assisted image analysis. Levels of {AR} in testicular cells declined sharply after treatment with the {LHRH} antagonist. In Sertoli cells, nuclear {AR} levels decreased to 8\% of control (P \textless 0. 01) after 4 wk treatment; and to 12\% and 17\% of control (P \textless 0.01) in Leydig and myoid cells, respectively. Androgen replacement resulted in complete recovery of nuclear {AR} levels in Sertoli cells (93\%, P \textgreater 0.05) but in only partial recovery in myoid (69\%, P \textless 0. 01) and Leydig cells (56\%, P \textless 0.01). In the epididymis, tubular epithelial cells and stromal cells differed in their responses to the {LHRH} antagonist. After 1 wk, nuclear {AR} levels in caput stromal cells decreased dramatically to 34\% of control (P \textless 0.01) and in cauda stromal cells to 43\% (P \textless 0.01). In contrast, the decline of {AR} levels in epididymal epithelial cells was not as dramatic as that in stromal cells. After 1 wk, the decline in the caput and cauda was to 87\% and 76\% of control, respectively. After 8 wk, nuclear {AR} levels in stromal cells further declined to 1.1\% in caput and 1.4\% in cauda, whereas in the epithelial cells, a smaller decline in nuclear {AR} was noted (to 30\% in the caput and 45\% in the cauda). After androgen replacement with {MENT}, nuclear {AR} levels recovered to more than 90\% of control in both epididymal cell types. These results indicate that {AR} levels in the nuclei of adult Sertoli cells depend mainly on the level of androgen, whereas in the adult Leydig and myoid cells, the androgen dependency is more limited. The results also indicate that in the epididymis, stromal cells are more sensitive than epithelial cells to the regulation of {AR} levels by androgen.}

abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Transposable Elements ({TEs}) or jumping genes are {DNA} sequences that have an intrinsic capability to move within a host genome from one genomic location to another. Studies show that the presence of a {TE} within or adjacent to a functional gene may alter its expression. {TEs} can also cause an increase in the rate of mutation and can even mediate duplications and large insertions and deletions in the genome, promoting gross genetic rearrangements. The proper classification of identified jumping genes is important for analyzing their genetic and evolutionary effects. An effective classifier, which can explain the role of {TEs} in germline and somatic evolution more accurately, is needed. In this study, we examine the performance of a variety of machine learning ({ML}) techniques and propose a robust method, {ClassifyTE}, for the hierarchical classification of {TEs} with high accuracy, using a stacking-based {ML} method. {RESULTS}: We propose a stacking-based approach for the hierarchical classification of {TEs}. When trained on three different benchmark datasets, our proposed system achieved 4\%, 10.68\%, and 10.13\% average percentage improvement (using the {hF} measure) compared to several state-of-the-art methods. We developed an end-to-end automated hierarchical classification tool based on the proposed approach, {ClassifyTE}, to classify {TEs} up to the super-family level. We further evaluated our method on a new {TE} library generated by a homology-based classification method and found relatively high concordance at higher taxonomic levels. Thus, {ClassifyTE} paves the way for a more accurate analysis of the role of {TEs}. {AVAILABILITY}: The source code and data are available at https://github.com/manisa/{ClassifyTE}. {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. \copyright The Author(s) (2021).

While cooperative binding of {TFs} at enhancers is known to be critical for transcriptional activation of a handful of developmental enhancers, the extent of {TF} cooperativity genome-wide is unknown. Here, we couple high-resolution nuclease footprinting with single-molecule methylation profiling to characterize {TF} cooperativity at active enhancers in the Drosophila genome. Enrichment of short micrococcal nuclease ({MNase})-protected {DNA} segments indicates that the majority of enhancers harbor two or more {TF}-binding sites, and we uncover protected fragments that correspond to co-bound sites in thousands of enhancers. From the analysis of co-binding, we find that cooperativity dominates {TF} binding in vivo at the majority of active enhancers. Cooperativity is highest between sites spaced 50 bp apart, indicating that cooperativity occurs without apparent protein-protein interactions. Our findings suggest nucleosomes promoting cooperativity because co-binding may effectively clear nucleosomes and promote enhancer function. Copyright \copyright 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Evidence from animal models has established the existence of a non-genetic mode of inheritance. This form of heredity involves transmission of the effects of parental exposure to the offspring through epigenetic changes in the germline. Studying the mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance in humans is challenging because it is difficult to obtain multigeneration cohorts, to collect reproductive cells in exposed parents, and to exclude psychosocial and cultural confounders. Nonetheless, epidemiological studies in humans exposed to famine, stress/trauma, or toxicants have provided evidence that parental exposure can impact the health of descendants, in some cases, across several generations. A few studies have also started to reveal epigenetic changes in the periphery and sperm after certain exposures. This article reviews these studies and evaluates the current evidence for the potential contribution of epigenetic factors to heredity in humans. The challenges and limitations of this fundamental biological process, its implications, and its societal relevance are also discussed. Copyright \copyright 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

By applying a sequence-based counting strategy that maintains the integrity of the fastq sequence, seqpac increases flexibility and transparency compared to other workflows. It also contains an innovative targeting system allowing sequence counts to be summarized and visualized across sample groups and sequence classifications. Reanalyzing published data, we show that seqpac\textquoterights fastq trimming performs equal to standard software outside R and demonstrate how sequence-based counting detects previously unreported bias. Applying seqpac to new experimental data, we discovered a novel {rRF} that was down-regulated by {RNA} pol I inhibition (anticancer treatment), and up-regulated in previously published data from tumor positive patients. Seqpac is available on github ( https://github.com/Danis102/seqpac ), runs on multiple platforms (Windows/Linux/Mac), and is provided with a step-by-step vignette on how to analyze {sRNA}-seq data.}

Comparison of Manatee against state-of-the-art implementations using real and simulated data demonstrates its high accuracy across diverse {sRNA} classes. Manatee also goes beyond common pipelines by identifying and quantifying expression from unannotated loci and {microRNA} isoforms ({isomiRs}). It is user-friendly, can be easily incorporated in pipelines, and provides a simplified output suitable for direct usage in downstream analyses and functional studies.}

abstract = {Background Next generation sequencing has allowed the discovery of {miRNA} isoforms, termed isomirs. Some isomirs are derived from imprecise processing of pre-{miRNA} precursors, leading to length variants. Additional variability is introduced by non-templated addition of bases at the ends or editing of internal bases, resulting in base differences relative to the template {DNA} sequence. We hypothesized that some component of the isomir variation reported so far could be due to systematic technical noise and not real. Results We have developed the {XICRA} pipeline to analyze small {RNA} sequencing data at the isomir level. We exploited its ability to use single or merged reads to compare isomir results derived from paired-end ({PE}) reads with those from single reads ({SR}) to address whether detectable sequence differences relative to canonical {miRNAs} found in isomirs are true biological variations or the result of errors in sequencing. We have detected non-negligible systematic differences between {SR} and {PE} data which primarily affect putative internally edited isomirs, and at a much smaller frequency terminal length changing isomirs. This is relevant for the identification of true isomirs in small {RNA} sequencing datasets. Conclusions We conclude that potential artifacts derived from sequencing errors and/or data processing could result in an overestimation of abundance and diversity of {miRNA} isoforms. Efforts in annotating the isomirnome should take this into account.}

Here we have elucidated {DNA} methylation changes during recent human brain evolution. We demonstrate dynamic evolutionary trajectories of {DNA} methylation in cell-type and cytosine-context specific manner. Specifically, {DNA} methylation in non-{CG} context, namely {CH} methylation, has increased (hypermethylation) in neuronal gene bodies during human brain evolution, contributing to human-specific down-regulation of genes and co-expression modules. The effects of {CH} hypermethylation is particularly pronounced in early development and neuronal subtypes. In contrast, {DNA} methylation in {CG} context shows pronounced reduction (hypomethylation) in human brains, notably in cis-regulatory regions, leading to upregulation of downstream genes. We show that the majority of differential {CG} methylation between neurons and oligodendrocytes originated before the divergence of hominoids and catarrhine monkeys, and harbors strong signal for genetic risk for schizophrenia. Remarkably, a substantial portion of differential {CG} methylation between neurons and oligodendrocytes emerged in the human lineage since the divergence from the chimpanzee lineage and carries significant genetic risk for schizophrenia. Therefore, recent epigenetic evolution of human cortex has shaped the cellular regulatory landscape and contributed to the increased vulnerability to neuropsychiatric diseases.}

Here, we developed a cell-based assay in which {EVs} containing luciferase- or fluorescent-protein tagged cytosolic cargoes are loaded on unlabeled acceptor cells. Results from dose-responses, kinetics, and temperature-block experiments suggest that {EV} uptake is a low yield process (\~1\% spontaneous rate at 1 h). Further characterization of this limited {EV} uptake, through fractionation of membranes and cytosol, revealed cytosolic release (\~30\% of the uptaken {EVs}) in acceptor cells. This release is inhibited by bafilomycin A1 and overexpression of {IFITM} proteins, which prevent virus entry and fusion. Our results show that {EV} content release requires endosomal acidification and suggest the involvement of membrane fusion.}

These two phenomena have brought about tremendous advances in scientific discovery but have raised two serious concerns. The complexity of modern data analyses raises questions about the reproducibility of the analyses, meaning the ability of independent analysts to recreate the results claimed by the original authors using the original data and analysis techniques. Reproducibility is typically thwarted by a lack of availability of the original data and computer code. A more general concern is the replicability of scientific findings, which concerns the frequency with which scientific claims are confirmed by completely independent investigations. Although reproducibility and replicability are related, they focus on different aspects of scientific progress. In this review, we discuss the origins of reproducible research, characterize the current status of reproducibility in public health research, and connect reproducibility to current concerns about the replicability of scientific findings. Finally, we describe a path forward for improving both the reproducibility and replicability of public health research in the future.}

Here we outline these models together with other types of mouse epigenetic inheritance models. Our focus is on the molecular basis of epigenetic inheritance and the experimental strategies to attack mechanistic problems. In particular, we point out the hurdles hampering mechanistic studies inherent in the conventional models of epigenetic inheritance, and describe our alternative models free of such hurdles. In our models, chromatin modifications are pharmacologically inducible at simple reporter genes, which facilitates the dissection of various potential determinants of epigenetic inheritance. Our results reveal that mitotically heritable chromatin modifications can be readily established as long as the inducers act at the critical times during embryogenesis, whereas the inheritance of chromatin modifications across generations additionally requires special locus environment. Understanding the mechanisms whereby heritable epigenetic states are established and perpetuated are of tremendous biological, evolutionary, and clinical importance. Mouse models have made and will continue to make extensive contributions to the field.}

abstract = {One of the most important developing cell types in any biological system is the gamete (sperm and egg). The transmission of phenotypes and optimally adapted physiology to subsequent generations is in large part controlled by gametogenesis. In contrast to genetics, the environment actively regulates epigenetics to impact the physiology and phenotype of cellular and biological systems. The integration of epigenetics and genetics is critical for all developmental biology systems at the cellular and organism level. The current review is focused on the role of epigenetics during gametogenesis for both the spermatogenesis system in the male and oogenesis system in the female. The developmental stages from the initial primordial germ cell through gametogenesis to the mature sperm and egg are presented. How environmental factors can influence the epigenetics of gametogenesis to impact the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of phenotypic and physiological change in subsequent generations is reviewed. \copyright The Author(s) 2021.

abstract = {Mammalian testes are very heterogeneous organs, with a high number of different cell types. Testicular heterogeneity, together with the lack of reliable in vitro culture systems of spermatogenic cells, have been an obstacle for the characterization of the molecular bases of the unique events that take place along the different spermatogenic stages. In this context, flow cytometry has become an invaluable tool for the analysis of testicular heterogeneity, and for the purification of stage-specific spermatogenic cell populations, both for basic research and for clinical applications. In this review, we highlight the importance of flow cytometry for the advances on the knowledge of the molecular groundwork of spermatogenesis in mammals. Moreover, we provide examples of different approaches to the study of spermatogenesis that have benefited from flow cytometry, including the characterization of mutant phenotypes, transcriptomics, epigenetic and genome-wide chromatin studies, and the attempts to establish cell culture systems for research and/or clinical aims such as infertility treatment.}

abstract = {In recent years, the research on stem cells has been more and more in-depth, and many achievements have been made in application. However, due to the small number of spermatogonial stem cells ({\SSCs}) and deficiency of efficient markers, it is difficult to obtain very pure {\SSCs}, which results in the research on them being hindered. In fact, many methods have been developed to isolate and purify {\SSCs}, but these methods have their shortcomings. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting ({FACS}), as a method to enrich {\SSCs} with the help of specific surface markers, has the characteristics of high efficiency and accuracy in enrichment of {\SSCs}, thus it is widely accepted as an effective method for purification of {\SSCs}. This review summarizes the recent studies on the application of {FACS} in {\SSCs}, and introduces some commonly used markers of effective {\SSCs} sorting, aiming to further optimize the {FACS} sorting method for {\SSCs}, so as to promote the research of germline stem cells and provide new ideas for the research of reproductive biology.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Long non-coding {RNAs} ({lncRNAs}) have a size of more than 200 bp and are known to regulate a host of crucial cellular processes like proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis by regulating gene expression. While small noncoding {RNAs} ({ncRNAs}) such as {miRNAs}, {siRNAs}, Piwi-interacting {RNAs} have been extensively studied in male germ cell development, the role of {lncRNAs} in spermatogenesis remains largely unknown. {OBJECTIVE}: In this article, we have reviewed the biology and role of {lncRNAs} in spermatogenesis along with the tools available for data analysis. {RESULTS} {AND} {CONCLUSIONS}: Till date, three microarray and four {RNA}-seq studies have been undertaken to identify {lncRNAs} in mouse testes or germ cells. These studies were done on pre-natal, post-natal, adult testis, and different germ cells to identify {lncRNAs} regulating spermatogenesis. In case of humans, five {RNA}-seq studies on different germ cell populations, including two on sperm, were undertaken. We compared three studies on human germ cells to identify common {lncRNAs} and found 15 {lncRNAs} ({LINC00635}, {LINC00521}, {LINC00174}, {LINC00654}, {LINC00710}, {LINC00226}, {LINC00326}, {LINC00494}, {LINC00535}, {LINC00616}, {LINC00662}, {LINC00668}, {LINC00467}, {LINC00608}, and {LINC00658}) to show consistent differential expression across these studies. Some of the targets of these {lncRNAs} included {CENPB}, {FAM98B}, {GOLGA6} family, {RPGR}, {TPM2}, {GNB5}, {KCNQ10T1}, {TAZ}, {LIN28A}, {CDKN2B}, {CDKN2A}, {CDKN1A}, {CDKN1B}, {CDKN1C}, {EZH2}, {SUZ12}, {VEGFA} genes. A lone study on human male infertility identified 9879 differentially expressed {lncRNAs} with three (lnc32058, lnc09522, and lnc98497) of them showing specific and high expression in immotile sperm in comparison to normal motile sperm. A few {lncRNAs} (Mrhl, Drm, Spga-{lncRNAs}, {NLC1}-C, {HongrES2}, Tsx, {LncRNA}-tcam1, Tug1, Tesra, {AK015322}, Gm2044, and {LncRNA033862}) have been functionally validated for their roles in spermatogenesis. Apart from rodents and humans, studies on sheep and bull have also identified {lncRNAs} potentially important for spermatogenesis. A number of these non-coding {RNAs} are strong candidates for further research on their roles in spermatogenesis.}

abstract = {The {CCA} sequence is conserved at the 3' end of all mature {tRNA} molecules to function as the site of amino acid attachment. This sequence is acquired and maintained by stepwise nucleotide addition by the ubiquitous {CCA} enzyme, which is an unusual {RNA} polymerase that does not use a nucleic acid template for nucleotide addition. Crystal structural work has divided {CCA} enzymes into two structurally distinct classes, which differ in the mechanism of template-independent nucleotide selection. Recent kinetic work of the class {II} E. coli {CCA} enzyme has demonstrated a rapid and uniform rate constant for the chemistry of nucleotide addition at each step of {CCA} synthesis, although the enzyme uses different determinants to control the rate of each step. Importantly, the kinetic work reveals that, at each step of {CCA} synthesis, E. coli {CCA} enzyme has an innate ability to discriminate against {tRNA} backbone damage. This discrimination suggests the possibility of a previously unrecognized quality control mechanism that would prevent damaged {tRNA} from {CCA} maturation and from entering the ribosome machinery of protein synthesis. This quality control is relevant to cellular stress conditions that damage {tRNA} backbone and predicts a role of {CCA} addition in stress response.}

Here, we provide a perspective on current {tRNA} topics with a spotlight on the regulation of post-transcriptional shaping of {tRNA} molecules. First, we give an update on aberrant structural features that a yet functional fraction of mitochondrial {tRNAs} can exhibit. Then, we outline several aspects of the regulatory contribution of ribonucleases with a focus on {tRNA} processing versus {tRNA} elimination.

Here, we present {xTea} (x-Transposable element analyzer), a tool for identifying {TE} insertions in whole-genome sequencing data. Whereas existing methods are mostly designed for short-read data, {xTea} can be applied to both short-read and long-read data. Our analysis shows that {xTea} outperforms other short read-based methods for both germline and somatic {TE} insertion discovery. With long-read data, we created a catalogue of polymorphic insertions with full assembly and annotation of insertional sequences for various types of retroelements, including pseudogenes and endogenous retroviruses. Notably, we find that individual genomes have an average of nine groups of full-length L1s in centromeres, suggesting that centromeres and other highly repetitive regions such as telomeres are a significant yet unexplored source of active L1s. {xTea} is available at https://github.com/parklab/{xTea} .}

abstract = {Meta-analyses increase statistical power by combining statistics from multiple studies. Meta-analysis methods have mostly been evaluated under the condition that all the data in each study have an association with the given phenotype. However, specific experimental conditions in each study or genetic heterogeneity can result in "unassociated statistics" that are derived from the null distribution. Here, we show that power of conventional meta-analysis methods rapidly decreases as an increasing number of unassociated statistics are included, whereas the classical Fisher's method and its weighted variant ({wFisher}) exhibit relatively high power that is robust to addition of unassociated statistics. We also propose another robust method based on joint distribution of ordered p-values (ordmeta). Simulation analyses for t-test, {RNA}-seq, and microarray data demonstrated that {wFisher} and ordmeta, when only a small number of studies have an association, outperformed existing meta-analysis methods. We performed meta-analyses of nine microarray datasets (prostate cancer) and four association summary datasets (body mass index), where our methods exhibited high biological relevance and were able to detect genes that the-state-of-the-art methods missed. The metapro R package that implements the proposed methods is available from both {CRAN} and {GitHub} ( http://github.com/unistbig/metapro ).}

Yet, there is increasing evidence that {PRC2} also targets and even silences transposable elements in representatives of several distantly related eukaryotic lineages. In plants and animals, {H3K27me3} is present on transposable elements in mutants and specific cell types devoid of {DNA} methylation.

Despite multiple layers of host defence, {TEs} actively shape mammalian-specific developmental processes, particularly during pre-implantation and extra-embryonic development and at the maternal-fetal interface. Here, we review how {TEs} influence mammalian genomes both directly by providing the raw material for genetic change and indirectly via co-evolving {TE}-binding Krüppel-associated box zinc finger proteins ({KRAB}-{ZFPs}). Throughout mammalian evolution, individual activities of ancient {TEs} were co-opted to enable invasive placentation that characterizes live-born mammals. By contrast, the widespread activity of evolutionarily young {TEs} may reflect an ongoing co-evolution that continues to impact mammalian development. \copyright 2021.

Rodent studies suggested germline {RNA} as a mediator of effects of chronic environmental exposures to the progeny. The effects of an acute paternal stress exposure on the germline and their potential consequences on offspring remain to be seen. We find that acute administration of an agonist for the stress-sensitive Glucocorticoid receptor, using the common corticosteroid dexamethasone, affects the {RNA} payload of mature sperm as soon as 3 hr after exposure. It further impacts early embryonic transcriptional trajectories, as determined by single-embryo sequencing, and metabolism in the offspring. We show persistent regulation of {tRNA} fragments in sperm and descendant 2-cell embryos, suggesting transmission from sperm to embryo. Lastly, we unravel environmentally induced alterations in sperm {circRNAs} and their targets in the early embryo, highlighting this class as an additional candidate in {RNA}-mediated inheritance of disease risk. \copyright 2021 The Author(s).}

abstract = {Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic mechanism of regulating parent-of-origin-specific monoallelic expression of imprinted genes in viviparous therian mammals such as eutherians and marsupials. In this review we discuss several issues concerning the relationship between mammalian viviparity and genomic imprinting, as well as the domestication of essential placental genes: why has the genomic imprinting mechanism been so widely conserved despite the evident developmental disadvantages originating from monoallelic expression? How have genomic imprinted regions been established in the course of mammalian evolution? What drove the evolution of mammalian viviparity and how have genomic imprinting and domesticated genes contributed to this process? In considering the regulatory mechanism of imprinted genes, reciprocal expression of paternally and maternally expressed genes ({PEGs} and {MEGs} respectively) and the presence of several essential imprinted genes for placental formation and maintenance, it is likely that complementary, thereby monoallelic, expression of {PEGs} and {MEGs} is an evolutionary trade-off for survival. The innovation in novel imprinted regions was associated with the emergence of imprinting control regions, suggesting that genomic imprinting arose as a genome defence mechanism against the insertion of exogenous {DNA}. Mammalian viviparity emerged in the period when the atmospheric oxygen concentration was the lowest (\~12\%) during the last 550 million years (the Phanerozoic eon), implying this low oxygen concentration was a key factor in promoting mammalian viviparity as a response to a major evolutionary pressure. Because genomic imprinting and gene domestication from retrotransposons or retroviruses are effective measures of changing genomic function in therian mammals, they are likely to play critical roles in the emergence of viviparity for longer gestation periods.}

However, the mechanisms underlying the edaphic adaptation remain elusive. Accordingly, whole genome bisulfite sequencing, {RNA}-sequencing, and metabolome analysis are performed on ten wild barley accessions inhabiting Terra Rossa and Basalt soil. A total of 121 433 differentially methylated regions ({DMRs}) and 10 478 {DMR}-genes are identified between the two wild barley populations. {DMR}-genes in {CG} context ({CG}-{DMR}-genes) are enriched in the pathways related with the fundamental processes, and {DMR}-genes in {CHH} context ({CHH}-{DMR}-genes) are mainly associated with defense response. Transcriptome and metabolome analysis reveal that the primary and secondary metabolisms are more active in Terra Rossa and Basalt wild barley populations, respectively. Multi-omics analysis indicate that sugar metabolism facilitates the adaptation of wild barley to dry Terra Rossa soil, whereas the enhancement of phenylpropanoid/phenolamide biosynthesis is beneficial for wild barley to inhabit moist and fungi pathogen-rich Basalt soil. The current results make a deep insight into edaphic adaptation of wild barley and provide elite genetic and epigenetic resources for developing barley with high abiotic stress tolerance. \copyright 2021 The Authors.

We performed multiregional reduced representation bisulfite sequencing ({RRBS}) of 62 resected lung nodules from 39 patients including atypical adenomatous hyperplasia ({AAH}, n=14), adenocarcinoma in situ ({AIS}, n=15), minimally invasive adenocarcinoma ({MIA}, n=22), and invasive adenocarcinoma ({ADC}, n=11). We observed significantly higher level of methylation {ITH} in later-stage lesions and gradual increase in both hyper- and hypomethylation compared to matched normal lung tissues over the course of neoplastic progression. The phyloepigenetic patterns inferred from methylation aberrations resembled those based on somatic mutations suggesting parallel methylation and genetic evolution during the early lung carcinogenesis. De-convolution of transcriptomic profiles from a previously published cohort and {RBBS} data from the current cohort demonstrated higher ratios of T regulatory cells (Tregs) versus {CD8}+ T cells in later-stage diseases implying progressive immunosuppression with neoplastic progression. Furthermore, increased global hypomethylation was associated with higher mutation burden, higher copy number aberration burden, higher allelic imbalance burden as well as higher Treg/{CD8} ratio highlighting the potential impact of methylation states on chromosomal instability, mutagenesis and the tumor immune microenvironment.}

We find weak evidence for direct selection on {DNA} methylation in any context, but thousands of differentially methylated regions ({DMRs}) are identified population-wide that are correlated with recent selection. For two trait-associated {DMRs}, vgt1-{DMR} and tb1-{DMR}, {HiChIP} data indicate that the interactive loops between {DMRs} and respective downstream genes are present in B73, a modern maize line, but absent in teosinte.

abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: The persistence of schizophrenia in human populations separated by geography and time led to the evolutionary hypothesis that proposes schizophrenia as a by-product of the higher cognitive abilities of modern humans. To explore this hypothesis, we used here an evolutionary epigenetics approach building on differentially methylated regions ({DMRs}) of the genome. {METHODS}: We implemented a polygenic enrichment testing pipeline using the summary statistics of genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}) of schizophrenia and 12 other phenotypes. We investigated the enrichment of association of these traits across genomic regions with variable methylation between modern humans and great apes (orangutans, chimpanzees and gorillas; great ape {DMRs}) and between modern humans and recently extinct hominids (Neanderthals and Denisovans; hominid {DMRs}). {RESULTS}: Regions that are hypo-methylated in humans compared to great apes show enrichment of association with schizophrenia only if the major histocompatibility complex ({MHC}) region is included. With the {MHC} region removed from the analysis, only a modest enrichment for {SNPs} of low effect persists. The {INRICH} pipeline confirms this finding after rigorous permutation and bootstrapping procedures. {CONCLUSION}: The analyses of regions with differential methylation changes in humans and great apes do not provide compelling evidence of enrichment of association with schizophrenia, in contrast to our previous findings on more recent methylation differences between modern humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans. Our results further support the evolutionary hypothesis of schizophrenia and indicate that the origin of some of the genetic susceptibility factors of schizophrenia may lie in recent human evolution.

Recent large-scale genomic studies have shown that mutations in players of the epigenetic machinery and concomitant perturbation of epigenomic patterning are frequent events in tumors. Among epigenetic marks, {DNA} methylation is one of the best studied. Hyper- and hypo-methylation events of specific regulatory elements (such as promoters and enhancers) are sometimes thought to be correlated with expression of nearby genes. High-throughput bisulfite converted sequencing is currently the technology of choice for studying {DNA} methylation in base-pair resolution and on whole-genome scale. Such broad and high-resolution coverage investigations of the epigenome provide unprecedented opportunities to analyze {DNA} methylation patterns, which are correlated with tumorigenesis, tumor evolution, and tumor progression. However, few computational pipelines are available to the public to perform systematic {DNA} methylation analysis. Utilizing open source tools, we here describe a comprehensive computational methodology to thoroughly analyze {DNA} methylation patterns during tumor evolution based on bisulfite converted sequencing data, including intra-tumor methylation heterogeneity.}

Moreover, methylation in gene regions along with {CpG} island regions could modulate the transcription to undetectable gene expression levels. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the methylation levels within the gene, gene body, {CpG} island regions, and their overlapped regions and then identify the gene-based differentially methylated regions ({GeneDMRs}). In this study, R package {GeneDMRs} aims to facilitate computing gene-based methylation rate using next-generation sequencing-based methylome data. The user-friendly {GeneDMRs} package is presented to analyze the methylation levels in each gene/promoter/exon/intron/{CpG} island/{CpG} island shore or each overlapped region (e.g., gene-{CpG} island/promoter-{CpG} island/exon-{CpG} island/intron-{CpG} island/gene-{CpG} island shore/promoter-{CpG} island shore/exon-{CpG} island shore/intron-{CpG} island shore). {GeneDMRs} can also interpret complex interplays between methylation levels and gene expression differences or similarities across physiological conditions or disease states. We used the public reduced representation bisulfite sequencing data of mouse ({GSE62392}) for evaluating software and revealing novel biologically significant results to supplement the previous research. In addition, the whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data of cattle ({GSE106538}) given the much larger size was used for further evaluation.}

We will address sperm-specific {DNA} methylation features and their potential evolutionary impacts, with particular emphasis on hypomethylated regions and repetitive elements. We will review recent examples of interindividual variability and intra-individual plasticity of the bull sperm methylome as related to fertility and age, respectively. Finally, we will address paternal methylome reprogramming after fertilization, as well as the mechanisms potentially involved in epigenetic inheritance, and provide some examples of disturbances that alter the dynamics of reprogramming in cattle. Because the selection of {AI} bulls is closely based on their genotypes, we will also discuss the complex interplay between sequence polymorphism and {DNA} methylation, which represents both a difficulty in addressing the role of {DNA} methylation in shaping phenotypes and an opportunity to better understand genome plasticity.}

For most species, queens and workers arise from a common genome, and so caste-specific developmental trajectories must arise from epigenetic processes. In this review, we examine the epigenetic mechanisms that may be involved in the regulation of caste dimorphism. Early work on honeybees suggested that {DNA} methylation plays a causal role in the divergent development of queen and worker castes. This view has now been challenged by studies that did not find consistent associations between methylation and caste in honeybees and other species. Evidence for the involvement of methylation in modulating behaviour of adult workers is also inconsistent. Thus, the functional significance of {DNA} methylation in social insects remains equivocal.

However, recent decades have seen an explosion of studies documenting the intergenerational and transgenerational effects of environmental conditions, forcing a re-evaluation of how external signals are sensed by, or communicated to, the germline epigenome.

In metazoans, the pattern of {DNA} methylation changes during embryogenesis and adult life. Consequently, differentiated cells develop a stable and unique {DNA} methylation pattern that finely regulates {mRNA} transcription during development and determines tissue-specific gene expression. Currently, {DNA} methylation remains poorly investigated in mollusks and completely unexplored in Mytilus galloprovincialis . To shed light on this process in this ecologically and economically important bivalve, we screened its genome, detecting sequences homologous to {DNA} methyltransferases ({DNMTs}), methyl-{CpG}-binding domain ({MBD}) proteins and Ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase ({TET}) previously described in other organisms. We characterized the gene architecture and protein domains of the mussel sequences and studied their phylogenetic relationships with the ortholog sequences from other bivalve species. We then comparatively investigated their expression levels across different adult tissues in mussel and other bivalves, using previously published transcriptome datasets. This study provides the first insights on {DNA} methylation regulators in M. galloprovincialis , which may provide fundamental information to better understand the complex role played by this mechanism in regulating genome activity in bivalves.}

abstract = {Purpose: Gene expression data generated from microarray technology is often analyzed for disease diagnostics and treatment. However, this data suffers with missing values that may lead to inaccurate findings. Since data capture is expensive, time consuming, and is required to be collected from subjects, it is worthwhile to recover missing values instead of re-collecting the data. In this paper, a novel but simple method, namely, {DSNN} (Doubly Sparse {DCT} domain with Nuclear Norm minimization) has been proposed for imputing missing values in microarray data. Extensive experiments including pathway enrichment have been carried out on four blood cancer dataset to validate the method as well as to establish the significance of imputation. Methods: A new method, namely, {DSNN}, was proposed for missing value imputation on gene expression data. Method was validated on four dataset, {CLL}, {AML}, {MM} (Spanish data), and {MM} (Indian data). All the dataset were downloaded from {GEO} repository. Missing values were introduced in the original data from 10 to 90\% in steps of 10\% because method validation requires ground truth. Quantitative results on normalized mean square error ({NMSE}) between the ground truth and imputed data were computed. To further validate and establish the significance of the proposed imputation method, two experiments were carried out on the data imputed with the proposed method, data imputed with the state-of-art methods, and data with missing values. In the first experiment, classification of normal vs. cancer subjects was carried out. In the second experiment, biological significance of imputation was ascertained by identifying top candidate tumor drivers using the existing state-of-the-art {SPARROW} algorithm, followed by gene list enrichment analysis on top candidate drivers. Results: Quantitative {NMSE} results of the {DSNN} method were compared with three state-of-the-art imputation methods. {DSNN} method was observed to perform better compared to these other methods both at high as well as low observable data. Experiment-1 demonstrated superior results on classification with imputation compared to that performed on missing data matrix as well as compared to classification on imputed data with existing methods. In experiment-2, cancer affected pathways were discovered with higher significance in the data imputed with the proposed method compared to those discovered with the missing data matrix. Conclusion: Missing value problem in microarray data is a serious problem and can adversely influence downstream analysis. A novel method, namely, {DSNN} is proposed for missing value imputation. The method is validated quantitatively on the application of classification and biologically by performing pathway enrichment analysis. Copyright \copyright 2020 Farswan, Gupta, Gupta and Kaur.}

abstract = {The rapid growth of high-throughput technologies has transformed biomedical research. With the increasing amount and complexity of data, scalability and reproducibility have become essential not just for experiments, but also for computational analysis. However, transforming data into information involves running a large number of tools, optimizing parameters, and integrating dynamically changing reference data. Workflow managers were developed in response to such challenges. They simplify pipeline development, optimize resource usage, handle software installation and versions, and run on different compute platforms, enabling workflow portability and sharing. In this Perspective, we highlight key features of workflow managers, compare commonly used approaches for bioinformatics workflows, and provide a guide for computational and noncomputational users. We outline community-curated pipeline initiatives that enable novice and experienced users to perform complex, best-practice analyses without having to manually assemble workflows. In sum, we illustrate how workflow managers contribute to making computational analysis in biomedical research shareable, scalable, and reproducible. \copyright 2021. Springer Nature America, Inc.}

abstract = {Current bioinformatics workflows for {PIWI}-interacting {RNA} ({piRNA}) analysis focus primarily on germline-derived {piRNAs} and {piRNA}-clusters. Frequently, they suffer from outdated {piRNA} databases, questionable quantification methods, and lack of reproducibility. Often, pipelines specific to {miRNA} analysis are used for the {piRNA} research in silico. Furthermore, the absence of a well-established database for {piRNA} annotation, as for {miRNA}, leads to uniformity issues between studies and generates confusion for data analysts and biologists. For these reasons, we have developed {WIND} ( Workflow for p {IRNAs} a Nd beyon D), a bioinformatics workflow that addresses the crucial issue of {piRNA} annotation, thereby allowing a reliable analysis of small {RNA} sequencing data for the identification of {piRNAs} and other small non-coding {RNAs} ({sncRNAs}) that in the past have been incorrectly classified as {piRNAs}. {WIND} allows the creation of a comprehensive annotation track of {sncRNAs} combining information available in {RNAcentral}, with {piRNA} sequences from {piRNABank}, the first database dedicated to {piRNA} annotation. {WIND} was built with Docker containers for reproducibility and integrates widely used bioinformatics tools for sequence alignment and quantification. In addition, it includes Bioconductor packages for exploratory data and differential expression analysis. Moreover, {WIND} implements a "dual" approach for the evaluation of {sncRNAs} expression level quantifying the aligned reads to the annotated genome and carrying out an alignment-free transcript quantification using reads mapped to the transcriptome. Therefore, a broader range of {piRNAs} can be annotated, improving their quantification and easing the subsequent downstream analysis. {WIND} performance has been tested with several small {RNA}-seq datasets, demonstrating how our approach can be a useful and comprehensive resource to analyse {piRNAs} and other classes of {sncRNAs}.

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing makes it possible to provide the genome-wide distribution of small non coding {RNAs} in a single experiment, and contributed greatly to the identification and understanding of these {RNAs} in the last decade. Small non coding {RNAs} gather a wide collection of classes, such as {microRNAs}, {tRNA}-derived fragments, small nucleolar {RNAs} and small nuclear {RNAs}, to name a few. As usual in {RNA}-seq studies, the sequencing step is followed by a feature quantification step: when a genome is available, the reads are aligned to the genome, their genomic positions are compared to the already available annotations, and the corresponding features are quantified. However, problem arises when many reads map at several positions and while different strategies exist to circumvent this problem, all of them are biased. In this article, we present a new strategy that compares all the reads that map at several positions, and their annotations when available. In many cases, all the hits co-localize with the same feature annotation (a duplicated {miRNA} or a duplicated gene, for instance). When different annotations exist for a given read, we propose to merge existing features and provide the counts for the merged features. This new strategy has been implemented in a tool, mmannot, freely available at https://github.com/mzytnicki/mmannot.}

However, it produces a huge amount of raw data that need to be preprocessed with fast and effective computational methods. {RNA}-Seq can look at different populations of {RNAs}, including {ncRNAs}. Indeed, in the last few years, several {ncRNAs} pipelines have been developed for {ncRNAs} analysis from {RNA}-Seq experiments. In this paper, we analyze eight recent pipelines ({iSmaRT}, {iSRAP}, {miARma}-Seq, Oasis 2, {SPORTS1}.0, {sRNAnalyzer}, {sRNApipe}, {sRNA} workbench) which allows the analysis not only of single specific classes of {ncRNAs} but also of more than one {ncRNA} classes. Our systematic performance evaluation aims at guiding users to select the appropriate pipeline for processing each {ncRNA} class, focusing on three key points: (i) accuracy in {ncRNAs} identification, (ii) accuracy in read count estimation and (iii) deployment and ease of use. \copyright The Author(s) 2019.

abstract = {The mechanisms by which epiphenotypes are transmitted transgenerationally through the parental germlines are poorly understood. Here we show that exposure of pregnant mouse F0 females during E7.5-E13.5 to bisphenol A results in obesity in the F2 progeny in the absence of additional exposure. This epiphenotype can be transmitted through the male and female germlines up to the F5 generation, decreases in F6, and disappears in F7. Analysis of chromatin changes in the sperm of the F1 generation reveals a widespread increase in chromatin accessibility at binding sites for {CTCF} and other transcription factors accompanied by alterations in {3D} organization. Comparison of the transmission of obesity between F2 and F5 and its disappearance in F7 with alterations in the binding of these transcription factors points to the activation of an enhancer in an intron of the Fto gene as the cause of transgenerational inheritance. Activation of the Fto enhancer results in a decrease of {m6A} in sperm {RNAs}, which may result in alterations of gene expression in the embryo after fertilization. Given the established involvement of {SNPs} in {FTO} in human obesity, the results suggest that both genetic and epigenetic alterations of the same gene can lead to the same phenotypic outcomes on human health.}

We describe the impact of genetic perturbation of the relevant methyltransferases in the mouse on the landscape of chromatin marks as well as the transcriptome. In addition, we discuss the specific neurodevelopmental growth syndromes and cancers resulting from pathogenic mutations in the human orthologues of these genes.

abstract = {Resilience in the face of major life stressors is changeable over time and with experience. Accordingly, differing sets of neurobiological factors may contribute to an adaptive stress response before, during, and after the stressor. Longitudinal studies are therefore particularly effective in answering questions about the determinants of resilience. Here we provide an overview of the rapidly-growing body of longitudinal neuroimaging research on stress resilience. Despite lingering gaps and limitations, these studies are beginning to reveal individual differences in neural circuit structure and function that appear protective against the emergence of future psychopathology following a major life stressor. Here we outline a neural circuit model of resilience to trauma. Specifically, pre-trauma biomarkers of resilience show that an ability to modulate activity within threat and salience networks predicts fewer stress-related symptoms. In contrast, early post-trauma biomarkers of subsequent resilience or recovery show a more complex pattern, spanning a number of major circuits including attention and cognitive control networks as well as primary sensory cortices. This novel synthesis suggests stress resilience may be scaffolded by stable individual differences in the processing of threat cues, and further buttressed by post-trauma adaptations to the stressor that encompass multiple mechanisms and circuits. More attention and resources supporting this work will inform the targets and timing of mechanistic resilience-boosting interventions. \copyright 2021. The Author(s).}

abstract = {{DNA} methylation is an important component in vital biological functions such as embryonic development, carcinogenesis, and heritable regulation. Accurate methods to assess genomic methylation status are crucial to its effective use in many scenarios, especially in the detection and diagnosis of disease. Methylation aligners, such as Bismark and bwa-meth, frequently assign significantly higher {MapQ} values than can be supported by the uniqueness of the region reads are mapped to. These incorrectly high {MapQs} result in inappropriate methylation calling in repetitive regions. We observe reads that should map to separate locations (possibly having different methylation states) actually end up mapping to the same locus, causing apparent mixed methylation at such loci. Methylation calling can be improved by using Bismap mappability data to filter out insufficiently unique reads. However, simply filtering out Cs in insufficiently unique regions is not adequate as it is prone to over-filtering Cs in small mappability dips. These Cs can in fact often be called using reads anchored in a nearby mappable region. We have created a new feature for the {MethylDackel} methylation caller to perform read-based filtering. This new methylation calling method resolves some of the apparent mixed methylation to either 0\% or 100\% methylation and removes many unsupportable methylation calls. We examined methylation calls with and without read-based filtering in or near the 7830 genes containing {ClinVar} variants in a methylation sequencing data set from the {NA12878} cell line. Use of this improved method corrected 41,143 mixed methylation Cs to 0\% methylation, and 22,345 to 100\% methylation throughout the genome.}

We found that the small {RNA} signature of epididymal {EVs}, particularly {miRNAs}, is altered in adult males exposed to postnatal stress. In some cases, these {miRNA} changes correlate with differences in the expression of their target genes in sperm and zygotes generated from that sperm. These results suggest that stressful experiences in early life can have persistent biological effects on the male reproductive tract that may in part be responsible for the transmission of the effects of exposure to the offspring. \copyright The Author(s) 2021.

Another major interest in the epididymis is that it is an attractive target for the development of male contraceptives. There are well over 16,000 peer reviewed articles in the literature on these tissues, their structure, gene expression, protein synthesis and function. Regular international meetings have been initiated that are dedicated to this field. Thus, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive reference volume that spans every facet of epididymal biology, from historical background to the most current results, from basic cell and molecular biology to clinical issues. Well-established experts from every part of the world have contributed to this volume. By necessity, each author was given page limitations so that many topics are not dealt with exhaustively.

The {tRNA}-derived small {RNAs} ({tsRNAs}), including {tRNA} halves ({tiRNAs}), and {tRNA} fragments ({tRFs}), were unexpectedly discovered and have been implicated in a variety of important biological functions such as cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and apoptosis. Mechanistically, {tsRNAs} regulate {mRNA} destabilization and translation, as well as retro-element reverse transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes. Emerging evidence has shown that {tsRNAs} are expressed in the heart, and their expression can be induced by pathological stress, such as hypertrophy. Interestingly, cardiac pathophysiological conditions, such as oxidative stress, aging, and metabolic disorders can be viewed as inducers of {tsRNA} biogenesis, which further highlights the potential involvement of {tsRNAs} in these conditions. There is increasing enthusiasm for investigating the molecular and biological functions of {tsRNAs} in the heart and their role in cardiovascular disease. It is anticipated that this new class of small non-coding {RNAs} will offer new perspectives in understanding disease mechanisms and may provide new therapeutic targets to treat cardiovascular disease.

Analyzing multiple small {RNA}-Seq libraries, we show most of these identified {miRNAs} are expressed in at least one of seven Nothobranchius species. Additionally, duplication and clustering of N. furzeri {miRNAs} was analyzed and compared to the four fish species Danio rerio, Oryzias latipes, Gasterosteus aculeatus and Takifugu rubripes. A peculiar characteristic of N. furzeri, as compared to other teleosts, was a duplication of the {miR}-29 cluster. {CONCLUSION}: The completeness of the catalogue we provide is comparable to that of the zebrafish. This catalogue represents a basis to investigate the role of {miRNAs} in aging and development in this species.}

Sequence analysis of histidine {tRNA} genes from Drosophila melanogaster and Schizosaccharomyces pombe showed that the terminal guanylate residue of the mature {tRNAs} is not encoded by the genes. Analysis of the products from in vitro transcription of these genes in extracts from Drosophila Kc cells demonstrated that the 5'-terminal nucleotide present in the mature {tRNA} is added post-transcriptionally. The addition reaction requires {ATP}. A portion of the mature {tRNAs} are then modified at the 5'-terminal {pG}. Analysis of the {RNA} species formed during the in vitro maturation of the Drosophila histidine {tRNA} primary transcript uncovered the following maturation scheme: (i) the primary transcript is processed by {RNase} P at the 5' end to form an intermediate precursor; (ii) the 3'-flanking sequence is endonucleolytically removed, and a guanylate moiety is added to the 5' end to form mature-sized histidine {tRNA}; and (iii) a fraction of the 5'-terminal guanylate residues then undergoes modification. In contrast to the capping of eukaryotic {mRNA}, the guanylate addition to histidine {tRNA} results in the formation of a (3'-5')-phosphodiester bond. There are no precedents for the post-transcriptional addition of nucleotides (in phosphodiester linkage) to the 5' end of {RNA} precursors.}

abstract = {Publisher {SummaryThis} chapter discusses that the adaptor role of {tRNA} requires that it has at least two functionally different sites-one for the specific interaction with the messenger, and one for accepting and transferring the particular amino acid to the growing polypeptide chain. The codon recognition mechanism of {tRNA} is explained in principle by the codon–anticodon interaction, including the wobble hypothesis, and has been confirmed by sequencing many {tRNAs}. The second function discusses that apart from the long-known fact that the -N-C-C-A end, common to all {tRNAs}, carries the amino acid in ester linkage, the problem of the specific attachment of an amino acid to its corresponding {tRNA} (the \textquotedblleftrecognition\textquotedblright problem) is still not solved. The chapter reviews that the -N-C-C-A end is not responsible for the specificity of the attachment; there must be other features in the molecule or in the enzymic mechanism of aminoacylation responsible for this high degree of specificity. However, these characteristics, whatever they are, must be seen in relation to the -N-C-C-A end, since this part of the {tRNA} carries the amino acid. Thus the presence of an intact -N-C-C-A end is a general prerequisite for the aminoacylation and for amino-acid transfer. It discusses the structural and the chemical requirements for the functioning of the -N-C-C-A terminus. The chapter summarizes recent results on the function of the -N-C-C-A end of {tRNA} as a reactive site during aminoacylation and ribosomal protein biosynthesis, with information about the structure of -N-C-C-A end and changes in its function after its modification.}

Here, we show that, in fact, it is the phosphate 5' to the extra nucleotide which mainly supports the efficiency of the {tRNA} aminoacylation reaction catalyzed by Escherichia coli histidyl-{tRNA} synthetase. In the case of the reaction of E. coli peptidyl-{tRNA} hydrolase, this atypical phosphate is dispensable. Instead, peptidyl-{tRNA} hydrolase recognizes the phosphate of the phosphodiester bond between residues -1 and +1 of {tRNA}(His). Recognition of the +1 phosphate of {tRNA}(His) by peptidyl-{tRNA} hydrolase resembles, therefore, that of the 5'-terminal phosphate of other elongator {tRNAs}.}

abstract = {{tRNAscan}-{SE} has been widely used for transfer {RNA} ({tRNA}) gene prediction for over twenty years, developed just as the first genomes were decoded. With the massive increase in quantity and phylogenetic diversity of genomes, the accurate detection and functional prediction of {tRNAs} has become more challenging. Utilizing a vastly larger training set, we created nearly one hundred specialized isotype- and clade-specific models, greatly improving {tRNAscan}-{SE}'s ability to identify and classify both typical and atypical {tRNAs}. We employ a new comparative multi-model strategy where predicted {tRNAs} are scored against a full set of isotype-specific covariance models, allowing functional prediction based on both the anticodon and the highest-scoring isotype model. Comparative model scoring has also enhanced the program's ability to detect {tRNA}-derived {SINEs} and other likely pseudogenes. For the first time, {tRNAscan}-{SE} also includes fast and highly accurate detection of mitochondrial {tRNAs} using newly developed models. Overall, {tRNA} detection sensitivity and specificity is improved for all isotypes, particularly those utilizing specialized models for selenocysteine and the three subtypes of {tRNA} genes encoding a {CAU} anticodon. These enhancements will provide researchers with more accurate and detailed {tRNA} annotation for a wider variety of {tRNAs}, and may direct attention to {tRNAs} with novel traits. \copyright The Author(s) 2021.

However, the doctrine or dogma of the Weismann barrier still influences many scientific fields and topics. The discovery of epigenetics, and more recently environmentally induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of phenotypic variation and pathology, have had significant impacts on evolution theory and medicine today. Environmental epigenetics and the concept of epigenetic transgenerational inheritance refute aspects of the Weismann barrier and require a re-evaluation of both inheritance theory and evolution theory.}

abstract = {Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in animals has increasingly been reported in recent years. Controversies, however, surround this unconventional mode of heredity, especially in mammals, for several reasons. First, its existence itself has been questioned due to perceived insufficiency of available evidence. Second, it potentially implies transfer of hereditary information from soma to germline, against the established principle in biology. Third, it inherently requires survival of epigenetic memory across reprogramming, posing another fundamental challenge in biology. Fourth, evolutionary significance of epigenetic inheritance has also been under debate. This article pointwise addresses all these concerns on the basis of recent empirical, theoretical and conceptual advances. 1) Described here in detail are the key experimental findings demonstrating the occurrence of germline epigenetic inheritance in mammals. 2) Newly emerging evidence supporting soma to germline communication in transgenerational inheritance in mammals, and a role of exosome and extracellular {microRNA} in this transmission, is thoroughly discussed. 3) The plausibility of epigenetic information propagation across reprogramming is highlighted. 4) Analyses supporting evolutionary significance of epigenetic inheritance are briefly mentioned. Finally, an integrative model of 'evolutionary transgenerational systems biology' is proposed to provide a framework to guide future advancements in epigenetic inheritance.}

abstract = {The testis is a key male reproductive organ that produces gametes through the process of spermatogenesis. Testis morphologies and spermatogenesis evolve rapidly in mammals, presumably due to the evolutionary pressure on males to be reproductively successful. The rapid evolution of the testis was shown to be reflected at the molecular level based on bulk-tissue work, but the molecular evolution of individual spermatogenic cell types across mammalian lineages remains largely uncharacterized. Here we report evolutionary analyses of single-nucleus transcriptome data for testes from eleven species that cover the three major mammalian lineages (eutherians, marsupials, egg-laying monotremes) and birds (the evolutionary outgroup), and include seven key primates. Our analyses reveal that the rapid evolution of the testis is driven by accelerated fixation rates of gene expression changes, amino acid altering substitutions, and newly emerged genes in late spermatogenic stages - likely facilitated by reduced pleiotropic constraints, haploid selection, and a transcriptionally permissive chromatin environment. We identify temporal expression changes of individual genes across species, which may have contributed to the emergence of species-specific phenotypes, but also conserved expression programs underlying ancestral spermatogenic processes. Sex chromosome analyses show that genes predominantly expressed in spermatogonia (i.e., germ cells fueling spermatogenesis) and Sertoli cells (i.e., somatic supporting cells) independently accumulated on X chromosomes across mammals during evolution, presumably due to male-beneficial selective forces. Further work uncovered that the process of meiotic sex chromosome inactivation ({MSCI}) also occurs in monotremes and hence is common to the different mammalian sex chromosome systems, contrary to previous inferences. Thus, the general mechanism of meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin ({MSUC}), which underlies {MSCI}, represents an ancestral mammalian feature. Together, our study illuminates the cellular and molecular evolution of mammalian spermatogenesis and associated selective forces, and provides a resource for investigating the biology of the testis across mammals.}

abstract = {Transcriptionally active chromatin is marked by tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 ({H3K4me3}) located after first exons and around transcription start sites. This epigenetic mark is typically restricted to narrow regions at the 5`end of the gene body, though a small subset of genes have a broad {H3K4me3} domain which extensively covers the coding region. Although most studies focus on the {H3K4me3} mark, the broad {H3K4me3} domain is associated with a plethora of histone modifications (e.g., H3 acetylated at K27) and is therein termed broad epigenetic domain. Genes marked with the broad epigenetic domain are involved in cell identity and essential cell functions and have clinical potential as biomarkers for patient stratification. Reducing expression of genes with the broad epigenetic domain may increase the metastatic potential of cancer cells. Enhancers and super-enhancers interact with the broad epigenetic domain marked genes forming a hub of interactions involving nucleosome-depleted regions. Together, the regulatory elements coalesce with transcription factors, chromatin modifying/remodeling enzymes, coactivators, and the Mediator and/or Integrator complex into a transcription factory which may be analogous to a liquid-liquid phase-separated condensate. The broad epigenetic domain has a dynamic chromatin structure which supports frequent transcription bursts. In this review, we present the current knowledge of broad epigenetic domains.}

abstract = {During fertilization, two of the most differentiated cells in the mammalian organism, a sperm and oocyte, are combined to form a pluripotent embryo. Dynamic changes in chromatin structure allow the transition of the chromatin on these specialized cells into an embryonic configuration capable of generating every cell type. Initially, this reprogramming activity is supported by oocyte-derived factors accumulated during oogenesis as proteins and {mRNAs}; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms that govern it remain poorly characterized. Trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 ({H3K27me3}) is a repressive epigenetic mark that changes dynamically during pre-implantation development in mice, bovine and pig embryos. Here we present data and hypotheses related to the potential mechanisms behind {H3K27me3} remodeling during early development. We postulate that the repressive {H3K27me3} mark is globally erased from the parental genomes in order to remove the gametic epigenetic program and to establish a pluripotent embryonic epigenome. We discuss information gathered in mice, pigs, and bovine, with the intent of providing a comparative analysis of the reprogramming of this epigenetic mark during early mammalian development.}

abstract = {Increasing evidence has demonstrated that fetal reprogramming events relevant to developmental origin of health and diseases ({DOHaD}) are mediated by epigenetic mechanisms, including {DNA} methylation and posttranslational histone modification. In this chapter, various epigenetic mechanisms that are potentially linked to environment-induced changes in fetal gene expression relevant to {DOHaD} are discussed. In addition to {DNA} methylation and histone modifications, other mechanisms (noncoding {RNA} and nucleosome remodeling) are included. Moreover, two stages of mammalian development are briefly discussed in the context of epigenetic reprogramming. These stages are early embryonic development and primordial germ cell development, and relevant epigenetic regulations that occur during these stages are discussed.}

The different types of {ncRNAs}, as well as the high complexity of these regulatory pathways, present a complex scenario; however, recent studies have shed some light on these questions, discovering the regulatory function of specific {ncRNAs} on concrete reproductive biology processes. This mini review will focus on the role of {ncRNAs} in spermatogenesis and oogenesis, and their potential use as biomarkers for reproductive diseases or for reproduction success.}

abstract = {Adult animal behaviors are determined by complex and dynamic changes in gene expression in different brain regions and are influenced by life experiences and environmental exposures. These stimuli affect gene expression through intricate mechanisms of regulation that largely implicate epigenetic factors, such as, {DNA} methylation, histone post-translational modifications, and non-coding {RNAs} ({ncRNAs}). Through these molecular pathways, some of the behavioral phenotypes associated with life experiences can be stably transmitted to descendants, sometimes across several generations. Rodent studies indicate that parental stressful and traumatic experiences can lead to behavioral despair, risk-taking behaviors, altered sociability and atypical responses to stressful stimuli in the offspring, whereas parental environmental enrichment has been associated with improved cognition and stress resilience in the offspring. Similar observations have been made in humans; children and grandchildren of genocide survivors show increased psychopathology and emotional disturbances. At the molecular level, changes in germline {ncRNAs} have been identified as likely vectors of transmission in rodents. The mechanisms linking behavioral stimuli to the germline, and factors responsible for these changes and their persistence across generations remain, however, largely unidentified.}

Remarkably, these epigenetic changes sometimes endure through meiosis and gametogenesis, thereby affecting phenotypic variation across generations, long after epigenetic changes were triggered. Transgenerational effects challenge our traditional understanding of inheritance. In this review, we focus on patterns of inheritance, molecular features, mechanisms that lead from environmental and genetic perturbations to phenotypic variation in later generations, and issues about study design and replication.}
