Tanwar August 2021 Preliminary Content Acknowledgements I want to thank a few people. Preface This is an example of a thesis setup to use the reed thesis document class (for LaTeX) and the R bookdown package, in general. Dedication You can have a dedication here if you wish. Abstract The preface pretty much says it all. Second paragraph of abstract starts here. "],
