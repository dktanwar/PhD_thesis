% This is the Reed College LaTeX thesis template. Most of the work
% for the document class was done by Sam Noble (SN), as well as this
% template. Later comments etc. by Ben Salzberg (BTS). Additional
% restructuring and APA support by Jess Youngberg (JY).
% Your comments and suggestions are more than welcome; please email
% them to cus@reed.edu

% See https://www.reed.edu/cis/help/LaTeX/index.html for help. There are a
% great bunch of help pages there, with notes on
% getting started, bibtex, etc. Go there and read it if you're not
% already familiar with LaTeX.
%
% Any line that starts with a percent symbol is a comment.
% They won't show up in the document, and are useful for notes
% to yourself and explaining commands.
% Commenting also removes a line from the document;
% very handy for troubleshooting problems. -BTS

% As far as I know, this follows the requirements laid out in
% the 2002-2003 Senior Handbook. Ask a librarian to check the
% document before binding. -SN

This doctoral thesis has been an accomplishment that would not have been possible, or anywhere near as enjoyable, without the help and support of a number of incredible individuals.

It is a pleasure to be a member of the Neuroepigenetics lab. Thank you to all the members of the Neuroepigenetics lab, past and present. The Neuroepigenetics group was always fun to work with and I learned a lot about experiments. Thank you so much! A special thanks to the present and past members of Y38 for motivating, and various scientific and non-scientific discussions. \newline\newline My sincere thanks to Prof.~Dr.~Mark Robinson and Prof.~Dr.~Tuncay Baubec for accepting to be my co-examiners and supporting me throughout my doctoral research. Thank you so much Mark for always being available and providing all the help in writing proposals, helping in supervising students, and discussing and providing solutions to the problems I was facing. \newline\newline I am indebted to Dr.~Pierre-Luc Germain for his expert supervision and all the support he has provided. I am grateful for all discussions and suggestions on both scientific and non-scientific issues. Thank you for being so nice and for all the support which was extremely helpful to reach this point.
