The small RNA composition of sperm could be changed during its final stage of maturation in the epididymis by extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by epididymal cells. We studied the effect of exposure to stress in early postnatal life on the transcriptome of epididymal EVs using a mouse model of transgenerational transmission. We found that the small RNA signature of epididymal EVs, particularly miRNAs, is altered in adult males exposed to postnatal stress. In some cases, these miRNA changes correlate with differences in the expression of their target genes in sperm and zygotes generated from that sperm. These results suggest that stressful experiences in early life can have persistent biological effects on the male reproductive tract that may in part be responsible for the transmission of the effects of exposure to the offspring. 2.2 Summary sentence miRNA cargo of extracellular vesicles in cauda epididymis is altered by paternal exposure to early life stress. This correlates with changes in the expression of target genes in sperm and in zygotes generated from that sperm. 2.3 Graphical Abstract 2.4 Key words epigenetics, epididymis, epididymosomes, early life stress, extracellular vesicles, miRNAs, sperm. 2.5 Introduction Post-testicular maturation of spermatozoa in the epididymis is an elaborate process that involves modifications of sperm RNA, protein, and lipid content (Nixon et al., 2015; Rejraji et al., 2006; Sharma et al., 2016; Skerget, Rosenow, Petritis, &amp; Karr, 2015; Tamessar et al., 2021). The epididymis is segmented into different parts, including the initial segment, caput, corpus, and cauda. Each segment has a distinct gene expression profile, and different protein and lipid composition. Some modifications in epididymal spermatozoa are conserved across species (Sellem et al., 2020). For example, ~50% of miRNAs, a class of small RNAs that are modified during caput to cauda epididymis transit, is identical in mouse and bovine spermatozoa (Sellem et al., 2020). One mechanism by which small RNA load in spermatozoa is modified along the epididymis is by uptake of extracellular vesicles (EVs), also known as epididymosomes, which are produced by epididymal epithelial cells (Reilly et al., 2016). Studies have shown that epididymosomes can be taken up by maturing sperm through proteins present on the sperm head such as dynamin in mice and tetraspanins or syntenins in humans (Caballero, Frenette, Belleannée, &amp; Sullivan, 2013; Reilly et al., 2016; Thimon, Frenette, Saez, Thabet, &amp; Sullivan, 2008; Zhou et al., 2019). Co-incubation experiments provided evidence for epididymosome-mediated transfer of miRNAs to spermatozoa (Reilly et al., 2016). Exogenous DNA and RNA can also be directly taken up by spermatozoa via artificial liposomes (Bachiller, Schellander, Peli, &amp; Rüther, 1991). 2.6 Results 2.6.1 Isolation of cauda epididymosomes confirmed by several methods 2.6.2 The number and size of epididymosomes in adult males are not altered by postnatal stress 2.6.3 miRNAs are persistently altered by postnatal stress in cauda epididymosomes 2.6.4 mRNA targets of miRNAs from cauda epididymosomes are altered by postnatal stress in sperm and in zygotes 2.7 Discussion 2.8 Materials and methods 2.8.1 Animals 2.8.2 MSUS 2.8.3 Tissue collection 2.8.4 Electron microscopy images 2.8.5 Epididymosomes isolation by ultracentrifugation 2.8.6 Immunoblotting 2.8.7 Nanoparticle tracking analysis 2.8.8 RNA isolation and epididymosomes profiling 2.8.9 Preparation and sequencing of sRNA-seq libraries from epididymosomes 2.8.10 RT-qPCR 2.8.11 Cholesterol measurements 2.8.12 Bioinformatics data analysis 2.9 Data availability The datasets collected for this study are available as follows: - sRNA-seq dataset of cauda epididymosomes before and after sizeselection: NCBI GEO under accession number GSE175976. - Codes for bioinformatics analysis of RNA-sequencing datasets and all corresponding differential expression analyses: Github repository https://github.com/mansuylab/alshanbayeva_et_al_2021[https://github.com/mansuylab/alshanbayeva_et_al_2021]. - Sperm and zygote sequencing datasets from previous publications can be found in ArrayExpress database at EMBL-EBI (www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress) with the accession number E-MTAB-5834 (sperm) and E-MTAB-6589 (zygotes). 2.10 Authors’ contributions AA and IMM conceived and designed the study.
