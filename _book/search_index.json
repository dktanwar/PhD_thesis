The small RNA composition of sperm could be changed during its final stage of maturation in the epididymis by extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by epididymal cells. We studied the effect of exposure to stress in early postnatal life on the transcriptome of epididymal EVs using a mouse model of transgenerational transmission. We found that the small RNA signature of epididymal EVs, particularly miRNAs, is altered in adult males exposed to postnatal stress. In some cases, these miRNA changes correlate with differences in the expression of their target genes in sperm and zygotes generated from that sperm. These results suggest that stressful experiences in early life can have persistent biological effects on the male reproductive tract that may in part be responsible for the transmission of the effects of exposure to the offspring. 2.2 Summary sentence miRNA cargo of extracellular vesicles in cauda epididymis is altered by paternal exposure to early life stress. This correlates with changes in the expression of target genes in sperm and in zygotes generated from that sperm. 2.3 Graphical Abstract 2.4 Key words epigenetics, epididymis, epididymosomes, early life stress, extracellular vesicles, miRNAs, sperm. 2.5 Introduction 2.6 Results 2.6.1 Isolation of cauda epididymosomes confirmed by several methods 2.6.2 The number and size of epididymosomes in adult males are not altered by postnatal stress 2.6.3 miRNAs are persistently altered by postnatal stress in cauda epididymosomes 2.6.4 mRNA targets of miRNAs from cauda epididymosomes are altered by postnatal stress in sperm and in zygotes 2.7 Discussion 2.8 Materials and methods 2.8.1 Animals 2.8.2 MSUS 2.8.3 Tissue collection 2.8.4 Electron microscopy images 2.8.5 Epididymosomes isolation by ultracentrifugation 2.8.6 Immunoblotting 2.8.7 Nanoparticle tracking analysis 2.8.8 RNA isolation and epididymosomes profiling 2.8.9 Preparation and sequencing of sRNA-seq libraries from epididymosomes 2.8.10 RT-qPCR 2.8.11 Cholesterol measurements 2.8.12 Bioinformatics data analysis 2.9 Data availability The datasets collected for this study are available as follows: - sRNA-seq dataset of cauda epididymosomes before and after sizeselection: NCBI GEO under accession number GSE175976. - Codes for bioinformatics analysis of RNA-sequencing datasets and all corresponding differential expression analyses: Github repository https://github.com/mansuylab/alshanbayeva_et_al_2021[https://github.com/mansuylab/alshanbayeva_et_al_2021]. - Sperm and zygote sequencing datasets from previous publications can be found in ArrayExpress database at EMBL-EBI (www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress) with the accession number E-MTAB-5834 (sperm) and E-MTAB-6589 (zygotes). 2.10 Authors’ contributions AA and IMM conceived and designed the study.
